#### About
> Building upon urban studies of public policy and planning's roles in the formation of the barrio, we turn our attention to how suburban forms operate in a multiracial and metropolitan context. This interactive map displays student investigations into how Chicano/a and Latino/a populations have impacted the economic, social, and spatial contours of suburbs in Greater Los Angeles

>The Barrio Suburbanism map is a collaborative research project created by undergraduate students at UCLA in the Department of Chicana/o and Central American Studies. Combining archival research, personal photography, census data, fieldwork, geolocating key sites, and a review of secondary sources, students have assembled a metropolitan story of Latino/a (sub)urbanization. Taken together, their investigations underscore themes of community formation, immigration, education, art, and public space within the frameworks of (sub)urban studies and planning history.

Their work adds a new primary source that can be used to contextualize national trends, in which Latino/as--immigrant and non-immigrant alike--are increasingly choosing suburbs and rural areas as their sites of settlement. As the first major metropolitan area in the nation to historically double its non-white suburban population, this question is particularly important to investigate in Los Angeles. Together, we ask, how does Chicano/a and Latino/a (sub)urbanism shape metropolitan space? What do individual suburbs reveal about broader (sub)urbanization processes impacting Chicano/a and Latino/a communities? And, what lessons does this birdâ€™s-eye perspective hold for those seeking to promote metropolitan equity?

This project uses the Boulevardier framework developed by UCLA scholar Dawn Childress and USC librarian Nathan Day, as well as a Map Marker icon developed by Berkay Sargin of the Noun Project. This is a front-end-only application that delivers TEI-encoded content to your webserver. It was developed using GitHub, a free web-based hosting site and collection of open source software. Each author contributed five XML files with site analysis, visual references, coordinates, and bibliographic sources related to five sites within a suburb of their choosing. You can learn more about the authors by selecting Contributors from the Main Menu. A copy of the syllabus is available upon email request to gcarpio@chavez.ucla.edu.
