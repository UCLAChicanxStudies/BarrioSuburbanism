> The Barrio Suburbanism map is a collaborative research project created by undergraduate students at UCLA in the Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies. Combining archival research, personal photography, census data, fieldwork, geolocating key sites, and a review of secondary sources, students have assembled a metropolitan story of Latino/a (sub)urbanization. Taken together, their investigations underscore themes of community formation, immigration, education, art, and public space within the frameworks of (sub)urban studies and planning history.
