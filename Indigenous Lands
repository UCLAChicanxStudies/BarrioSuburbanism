> We would like to acknowledge that the lands that we live and work on, as well as those we seek to understand and represent, are those which were cultivated and occupied by the Gabrielino-Tongva, Chumash and Kizh Nations for thousands of years. The 1.2 million acres of land promised to the Gabrielino-Tongva tribe and other Mission Indians as compensation for relocation and expropriation were never officially allocated to the rightful owners of this land. We thank the Gabrielino-Tongva, Chumash, Kizh and associated Indigenous Nations for providing us with resources to better understand and learn from Indigenous ways of life and contributions to the historical development of the Los Angeles Basin and surrounding regions. For more information, see [Gabrielino Tribe History](https://gabrielinotribe.org/history/), [Tongva Peoples History](https://www.tongvapeople.org/), [Gabrielino Tongva Tribe Official Site](http://gabrielino-tongva.com/), [Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation Official Site](https://coastalbandofthechumashnation.weebly.com/), and the [Kizh Nation Official Site](https://gabrielenoindians.org/)

> [Native-Land.ca](https://native-land.ca) "offers an online platform where users can interact with maps of Indigenous territories, treaties, and languages, and locate themselves and their favorite places on the map. Fundamentally, the maps aim to visualize the complexity and diversity of Indigenous peoples, nations, and cultures across the Americas, Australia, and increasingly the world, so that nonIndigenous and Indigenous people alike can increase their understanding and knowledge of the breadth and depth of Indigenous history in these places."

> "In Indigenous teachings, the relationship between humans and the land has always been discussed, as Indigenous people hold the land up as both a living being and as a teacher. â€˜Living lightly' on the land has always been emphasized as a means of minimizing environmental impact and ensuring a continued quality of life for future generations to come. Looking at the land from an Indigenous perspective means understanding that the land is a living being; this understanding both gives us insight into and increases our awareness of how we treat and interact with the land. From a classroom perspective, using the land as a teacher allows us to breathe life into the maps that we look at, as well as imagine the land that we live on in new and creative ways."
