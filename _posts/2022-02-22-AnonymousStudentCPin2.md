The Estrada Courts public housing project was built in 1942 in response to the housing shortage in America due to veterans returning home from war and increased immigration. Due to the high demand of the defense industry during war time defense workers were considered essential and gained housing priority in public housing projects (Gonzalez, 47). Estrada Courts reserved two hundred and fourteen units for defense housing, however, as it expanded it opened its doors to more and more low income and immigrant families allowing for a level of integration not typically seen in urban planning influenced by racist Federal Housing Administration policies (Los Angeles Conservancy). The murals by Chicano artists that fill the walls of the Estrada Courts complex started in the 1970s embodied and were inspired by the Chicano movement. Decades later we can still look at these murals and gain insight about Chicano history as well as on the community “that lives with them” (Womack, 2016).
