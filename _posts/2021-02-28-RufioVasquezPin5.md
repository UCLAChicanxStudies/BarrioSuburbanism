The railroad is what originally allowed the community in San Fernando to develop into a booming suburb. With the demographic shift to a largely Latinx community, the Metrolink is a busy hub for labor workers who make the commute to the city every day for work. Recent data released by the Los Angeles Metro in June of 2020 shows that Latinx women make up the overwhelming majority of Metro ridership (Hymon et al.) In an effort to provide an efficient, affordable commute option for this population, the city of Los Angeles has approved the East San Fernando Light Rail Project to connect San Fernando to the Orange line. With an anticipated ridership to exceed 30,000 daily boardings by the year 2040 (LA Metro), San Fernando and the rest of the reemerging immigrant gateway (Brettell et al, 9.) of the Valley at large will be more connected than ever.
