The church was first established in east Claremont during the 1920's. Initially, visiting priests celebrated Masses in private homes. In January of 1939, the church was built and it was designated a mission church. The church operates around five core values, which are spirituality, integrity, discipleship, life-long learning, and fellowship. This catholic church offered Spanish masses, which attracted more Latinos to this area, as they had a space to celebrate their religion.
