Opened in 1992 the Salvadoran food serving Don Lencho's restaurant has been a staple in the growing Salvadoran culture in Los Angeles. Serving a variety of typical dishes from El Salvador with ingredients brought from El Salvador, it really tastes like being in El Salvador. The restaurant design is what you would expect out of a restaurant in a pueblo in El Salvador, it is outside dining with an aluminum roof covering, the tables and chairs are also different and usually just plastic. This food is still really the biggest reason why Don Lencho is able to attract their customers. The restaurant serves as a typical hang out spot for Salvadorans where they can feel at home, it also serves as an invitation for Non-Salvadorans to experience the Salvadoran culture for themselves.
