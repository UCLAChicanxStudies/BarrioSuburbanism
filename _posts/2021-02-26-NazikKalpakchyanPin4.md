Alex Theatre is a performing art and entertainment center located in Glendale, California. This center hosts different events such as concerts, theatre performances, and so forth. In recent years Alex Theatre has formed coalitions with the Latino community. For example, in 2014, the Glendale Latino Association hosted an event at the theatre called "Salsa for Scholarships." Moreover, a live taping of the HBO comedy "Entre Nos" was also hosted, with free admission for community members (Alex Theatre 2021). This recent diversification in Glendale's theatre is significant because in the past, immigrants in the U.S., especially Mexican Americans, were criticized for not conforming to the language and norms of American society (Ochoa 2004, 99). Through exclusion, the rich cultures of these peoples were disregarded. Considering Glendales racist history, which implemented sundown laws, it is evident that its Latino residents were also subject to exclusionary acts (Seidman 2020). Therefore, the diversification of Glendale's entertainment is a step towards appreciating the different cultures of Glendale's community members.
