Boyle Heights has been reputed for being ethnically diverse and an example of democratic progress in the 1950s, but it has become primarily Mexican American. The 20th century set it up through intricate residential segregation initiated by the real estate industry that placed white people on the west and foreign-born, nonwhite residents on the east. Due to the tolerant and multiethnic working-class community, it was a hub of activism. Historically, the building houses the Community Service Organization, established by activists Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. Establishing the CSO allowed for voter power and fueled the Chicano movement. It continues to provide counseling services, disaster services, emergency food, family education services, family support services, and youth services. It seems appropriate that this site became City Hall and a part of the community's Civic Center, including the Boyle Heights Neighborhood Council, the Department of Aging, College Track, and the Lucille Roybal Family Source Center.
