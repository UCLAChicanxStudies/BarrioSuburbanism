The Latino Suburb of Barrio Logan in San Diego has long dealt with environmental injustices and discriminatory housing clauses and policies. Located along the shoreline of downtown San Diego and across the bay from the affluent community of Coronado, the city decided to build a bridge connecting the coast with the peninsula in 1967. Through eminent domain, the city displaced thousands of families from the community, similar to the Chavez Ravine community in Los Angeles when Dodger Stadium was built. Chicano Park is the physical manifestation of civil disobedience and the Chicano Movement. After weeks of protest, the community was granted their demands for a park instead of the California Highway Patrol Station the city planned. The park is located underneath the junction of the Coronado bridge and Interstate 5. The pillars are decorated with murals depicting the fight for the park as well as many figures from the Chicano Movement.
