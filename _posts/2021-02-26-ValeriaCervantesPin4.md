Los Altos High School has been open since 1958 and consisted mostly of white students, teachers, and administrators reflecting the racial demographics of Hacienda Heights at the time. As Hispanic immigrant families moved into the suburb in the 70s and 80s, the school’s ethnic population changed to a Hispanic majority. Los Altos’ gymnasium was a site of town meetings and hearings to discuss the expansion of the Puente Hills Landfill in 1983 and a water pollution disaster. These events allowed the Hispanic community to have a say in Hacienda Heights’ urban planning, provided a sense of solidarity with their neighbors, and even resulted in the formation of a water quality committee in 1985. Since Catholicism is very important to many Hispanic families, many immigrant parents felt comfortable sending their children to attend Los Altos High with St. John Vianney Catholic Church just across the street from it (Deverell, 153).
