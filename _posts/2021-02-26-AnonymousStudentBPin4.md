Whittier College is a private 4-year liberal arts college. The ethnic makeup of the student population of Whittier College is 47% Latino (whittier.edu). Whittier College provides 85% of their students with some sort of financial aid, so this means that any students who may have financial struggles can access higher education (whittier.edu). In the beginning of chapter 3 for the Vallejo reading, the author includes a quote from a second generation Latino that mentions that their financial situation was a major deciding factor in whether or not they attended college (Vallejo, 2012). This is a common issue that many first, second and beyond generation Latino students face. Nevertheless, Whittier College makes it possible for those students to further their education by offering financial aid to more than half of its students. It is because of this that Whittier College is a significant location for the Latino community in Whittier.
