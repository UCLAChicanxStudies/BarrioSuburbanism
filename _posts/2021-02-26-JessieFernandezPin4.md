Our Lady of Guadalupe is represented by the image in the city of Ontario. Since its founding in 1935, the church has served to provide a safe haven for many individuals of Hispanic descent. It was one of the first churches within the area that catered to individuals who only spoke Spanish, providing a source for the spiritual needs of a rising Hispanic-dominant population in the city. Moreover, this church was established in a community within Ontario that was already Hispanic-dominant which was overshadowed by the surrounding areas of which were White-dominant. The problem with this was that ethnic Mexicans were almost always excluded from worship at many whites-only churches, with the exception of a few special masses throughout the year (Gonzalez, 33). Essentially, this led to even more segregation within Ontario, in which Our Lady of Guadalupe seeked to eliminate and successfully did in the “suburbia” era of Ontario.
