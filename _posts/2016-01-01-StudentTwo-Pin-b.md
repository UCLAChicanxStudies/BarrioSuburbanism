This trailer park is one of the multiple trailer parks located in the San Gabriel Valley. The trailer park that I initially chose as a pin because it is where my family lived last year is no longer there which can be correlated with turnover rates of renters and push factors against low income families out of Rosemead. Trailer parks existing in conjunction with residential areas in Rosemead is relevant to its exclusionary history of racial covenants and stratified neighborhoods within the San Gabriel Valley. The work Barrio Urbanism by David Diaz discusses the lack of affordable housing that arose in areas such as the San Gabriel Valley with the rise of Chicana/o urbanism (Diaz 245). A change in the demographics from exclusively white to a multiethnic geographic area signals positive social change but is also intertwined with issues of poverty and overcrowding in suburbs with increasing populations.
