Located in the outskirts of Montebello, The Simons Brickyard Company employed over 3,000 Chicanx immigrants in the 20th century (Rasmussen). The manufacturing plant quickly became more than just a production site, but a community site for many employed families. Those who worked and resided near the plant even went as far as naming the area, “El Pueblo de Simons”. The brickyard included amenities such as a central plaza, a church and a school, this allowed an early formation of a unique Chicanx identity in Montebello. Even though the brickyard was the top producing manufacturer of its kind, many of the Chicanx families' employed homes did not have access to electricity or plumbing (Deverell). The Simons Brickyard highlights a common issue faced by Chicanx immigrants in the 20th century; exploitative labor disproportionately endured by immigrants that have contributed to a lack of economic mobility. Alejandro Morales, the author of The Brick People, argues that the Simons Brickyard contributed to the prevalence of racial inequality in the Los Angeles area, while also instigating the formation of barrios (Morales).
