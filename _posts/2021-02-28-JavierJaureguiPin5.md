Residing in one of the most densely populated neighborhoods of Los Angeles, Central American inhabitants of the Westlake neighborhood take the concept of space to another level when it comes to their daily lives (Los Angeles TImes). The sidewalks of South Bonnie Brae St and West 6 St are an example of Central Americans applying thier concept of space in the neighborhood of Westlake. Overtime, with the arrival of Central Americans and “white flight,” these sidewalks on South Bonnie Brae St and West 6 St have become a space where Guatemalan street food vendors gather every night at 5pm (Diaz, 28; New York Times). Utilizing these streets as street food vending markets has been made possible by community efforts to protect and defend street food vendors in the area. CHIRLA and CARECEN, organizations that provide various resources to the immigrant population of Westlake, are considered a trailblazer when it came to its efforts of legalizing street food vending in Westlake.
