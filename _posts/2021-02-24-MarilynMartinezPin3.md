Porto’s Bakery is a prominent chain of bakeries located in Southern, California. The bakery was opened by Rosa Porto, a Cuban immigrant fleeing communism. The addition of their bakery to Glendale, California reflects the city’s transformation from a predominantly white and working-class suburb to a suburb with “increasing ethnic diversification” and the “reemergence of large immigrant and multiethnic communities” (Nicolaides and Weise, 2006). In fact, today a large portion of Glendale residents, or 54% of them are foreign-born immigrants (Mapping L.A. > Glendale, 2000). Although Porto’s is considered a large corporation, it is still run as a family business and spearheaded by Rosa Porto’s children. The store provides customers with an authentic Cuban experience while upholding the highly valued luxury and leisure that is found in Glendale California. As one customer remarks, Porto’s is the “lauded Cuban bakery that always has a massive line out the door” for its seemingly never-ending demand (Galindo, 2020).
