This port of entry processed nearly 40 million Northbound travelers in 2019 (Mendoza), with an average of over 100,000 people crossing North on a daily basis. A very large percentage of them are commuters or students who cross the border multiple times per week. While some who live in Tijuana but work across the border do so because of residency issues, there are many who do so simply because of the high cost of living in San Diego (Border Report Team). It is also extremely common for San Diego area residents to frequently cross the border South to visit family or friends in Mexico, and vice-versa. The fact that there is such frequent and large-scale bi-national interaction deeply influences the people, and culture of the San Diego area, and the way it is normalized is indicative of its status as an “Established Gateway” of immigration (Singer 9).
