El Mambi Super Market is a “Latin store” located in Southern Glendale, California (Andrew J., 2020). The store is owned by an immigrant man from Spain, however, it is largely operated by two Mexican women. The employment of these Mexican women demonstrates “a [key] factor in the labor market,” where Mexican American women usually participate in the economy as store clerks, laundresses, and domestics (Diaz, 2005). Additionally, the owner rents six apartments that are attached to the store to people of mostly Latino descent, thus making full use of his property and posing as a placemaker. The store is crowded, however, it resembles the feel of a traditional Mexican Mercado. Moreover, the store caters to the tastes of the 10.5% of residents that claim Mexican ancestry within this suburb (Mapping L.A. > Glendale, 2000). The store provides customers with a huge array of Goya products that are perfect for cooking Mexican cuisine. One customer even exclaims “ support El Mambi for all your Latino goodies!” (Angelo S., 2020).
