The Rancho San Pedro Housing Projects are located at Center St. and Santa Cruz St. in the Barton Hill Neighborhood of San Pedro. These properties sit on 21 acres of land and house 478 families, ranging from one-to-five bedroom units. The Projects are owned by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA), and were built initially in 1939 as housing units for Navy shipyard workers. In 1952, the property was expanded and converted to public housing projects. These housing projects have been spaces of struggle over the course of their existence. Beginning in the 1960s, the area experienced heightened gang violence and public disinvestment. In 1987, government officials advocated for the demolition of the projects due to blight and turf violence. Against all odds, the Rancho San Pedro Housing Projects still stand today, and in 2020, the Housing Authority unraveled plans for renovation and expansion. Over the next few decades, the Rancho San Pedro Housing Project is slated to increase threefold and transition to a mixed-income community, meaning that the community will have affordable housing units, market-rate units, and units for sale. Currently, the overwhelming majority of residents are of Hispanic/Latinx origin, and the median income is $40,000 a year.
