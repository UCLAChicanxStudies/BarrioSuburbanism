Vallarta Supermarkets sell Latinx products and fresh produce (“Our Story”). The store also consists of a panadería, tortillería, and taquería. Establishing this type of supermarket in West Covina suggests that the city has a large population of Hispanics and Latinx Americans. Moreover, Vallarta Supermarkets employ many Hispanic people because the store’s main consumers tend to be Spanish-speakers. As a result, it combats the alienation of barrio consumers and generates another source of income for people within West Covina’s Hispanic community who may have trouble finding work due to language barriers. America has historically “target[ed] the language, culture, food and dress of immigrant or ethnic minority groups'' (Carpio, 00:12:00-00:12:09). Thus, Vallarta Supermarkets’ “bilingual staff [develops] a reasonable patronage within the barrio economy'' (Diaz, 33), while Latinx and/or Hispanic residents are able to preserve their cultures within the suburbs of Eurocentric America.
