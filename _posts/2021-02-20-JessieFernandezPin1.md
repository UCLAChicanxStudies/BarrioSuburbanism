The Sunkist Factory, also known as the citrus packing house, is represented by the image in the city of Ontario. Through the uprising of Ontario, the citrus industry was a significant component in attracting Hispanic families due to job opportunities as well as affordable housing as a result of Sunkist building homes for their employees. Although this appeared as beneficial for many new Hispanic residents, it caused further segregation within Ontario due to the surrounding areas becoming Hispanic-dominant. The city provided many individuals of Mexican descent with low-wage labor through the citrus fields and packing houses (Diaz, 39). Despite the shutting down of Sunkist, it was one of the first major industrial factories to serve Ontario’s residents with a source of income-- especially impacting the migration of Hispanic workers seeking employment opportunities in the Inland Empire. A once thriving citrus factory for all Southern California’s citrus market, can now only be viewed as a stand-alone tower.
