Jurupa Valley is California's newest city; it is located in the upper western region of Riverside County (Jurupa Valley). The city itself is made up of fragmented neighborhoods, commercial areas, and industrial zones. Poor neighborhoods that began as Mexican immigrant barrios over 150 years ago, when the citrus industry was in full swing, are separated by wealthier, white neighborhoods. (Garcia; Gonzales). The poorer communities of the city known as Rubidoux and Mira Loma are separated by Pedley and the Indian Hills neighborhood (Policy Map). Furthermore, the construction of newer suburbs has added to the disparities within the city. These disparities become physically visible when one pays attention to the fact that the wealthier (and often whiter) neighborhoods have nicer roads, are next to the better high school and have access to the nicer recreational facilities, and are also furthest from the factories, the warehouses, and the logistical centers.
