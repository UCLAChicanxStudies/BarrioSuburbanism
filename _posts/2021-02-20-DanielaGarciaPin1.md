Located in the heart of Santa Ana, el Consulado de Mexico serves as an extension of the Mexican government outside of its country. As stated by author Julie Weise, the Mexican consulate was established in order to “provide the only formal structure for collective activity among Mexican immigrants” (Weise, 760).  El Consulado handles minor diplomatic matters such as issuing birth registrations, providing passports and identification cards, handling marriage certificates and at times arrange transport for the deceased Mexican citizens living in the US. In addition, El Consulado has various commissions who are there to promote and to inform the public about community resources. They provide adults with the resources to finish their education, find a lawyer, find jobs and even locate wellness resources. An additional resource that has been provided by El Consulado in the previous months is a food bank and a free COVID-19 testing site.
