Henning Lynwood Youth Center serves and caters to the underserved youth of Lynwood,CA. This site is a multipurpose center that offers a play area, an outdoor basketball court, and a computer section for students who do not have access to the internet. An additional source this site provides during the pandemic is distribution of meals every weekday to low income students in this city. Latinos over the years have hoped for gradual upward mobility, as they relied less on the wages of picking and more on the increased industrial opportunities in the suburban sphere (González,32-33). Yet it is at a young age that Latino youth are already viewed and racialized as racialized minorities and face the added challenge of obtaining jobs in a restricted economy that ultimately leads to downward mobility or economic stagnation over the generations (Vallejo,3). Since 1989, this center has brought the Latina/o/x community together and has worked on reshaping the youth outcomes and futures.
