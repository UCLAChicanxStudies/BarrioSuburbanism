Although Eastlake is commonly referred to as if it were a single neighborhood, strictly speaking, there are seven neighborhoods in Chula Vista that have “Eastlake” in the name. The median household incomes of these neighborhoods range from $88,000 to $111,000 (“Statistical Atlas – Income”) and the percentage of the population that is identified as Hispanic ranges from 44% to 55% (“Statistical Atlas – Race”). Eastlake is not only notable for having a large concentration of affluent Latinx people, but because of its close proximity to the border, it is actually home to many families who are a part of Tijuana’s elite, effectively acting as a cross-border suburb for many of them. It has even been humorously referred to as “a gilded colony of Mexicans” and “the city with the highest standard of living in all of Mexico” (Marosi).
