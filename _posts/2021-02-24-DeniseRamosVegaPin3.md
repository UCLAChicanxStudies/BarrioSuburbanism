Ritmo Latino shops used to be a common sight within communities with a high concentration of Latinxs. They carried items such as DVD’s, CD’s and other media. From the latest Los Temerarios CD to an old Vicente Fernandez concert video, they had it all. This particular shop was located on the corner of Fourth Street and French Street, but unfortunately closed down as Fourth Street underwent many changes.It was replaced by a “retro-style” barber shop. Many of the changes that occurred came as a result of the fact that shops were no longer producing as much revenue as they once did. Within Barrios to Burbs, Vallejo discusses the emergence of the Mexican American Middle class and their efforts to assimilate into American society. Part of this assimilation included shopping on sites like Amazon or shopping at stores like Ralph’s and Walmart, forgetting the shops that they once frequented on Calle Cuatro.
