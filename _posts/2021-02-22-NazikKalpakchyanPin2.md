El Mambi Supermarket, located in Glendale, CA, is known for carrying various products that cater to its Latinx consumers' specific needs. Because such products are not readily available in Glendale, this market is praised for its inclusivity. This market is unique in that it provides products that are denied to Latinx consumers because of their lack of popularity amongst the American public, and this is significant because, as stated by Diaz, often "Euro-American businesses did not offer Mexican products and specialty foods" (Diaz 2005, 33). For instance, one yelp consumer stated, "The Spaniard who owns the market does a GREAT job stocking the specific Cuban items I need" (Micheal 2020). Similarly, another commented, "They really carry a great variety of cultural staples from Spain to Argentina and everything in between" (D R. 2020).  Therefore, the El Mambi establishment is appreciated by its consumers for bringing about cultural diversity to Glendale's markets by fighting against assimilation.
