Opened in the year 2012, it is still a fairly new high school in the Los Angeles School District. With a campus that looks like it could be part of an Ivy league school in the middle of South Central. The school was designed with three smaller schools, RISE(business school) , C:Dags( Critical Design and Gaming), and Chas(Community Health Advocates). The student is allowed to decide which school they want to attend but they are all part of one campus. The school is built by a student body of 49% Hispanics 49% African American and 2% any. A number of the Hispanic students have recently migrated into the country and do not know any english. There is a program that is designed exclusively to assist these students. The school also relies on community circles in order to solve problems it is facing through restorative justice.
