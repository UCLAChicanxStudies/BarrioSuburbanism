ELAC has been around in South Gate since 1997 in an attempt to address the educational needs of the community. Education, as we know, is one of the factors that contributes to economic mobility and class but ELAC’s role in SG is interesting. It is a two-year college for students wishing to gain their associates degree. Though ELAC was meant to be close to the community in need, students often feel like it’s their only option because of their financial need. It adds to the number of people with a college education, but many often get stuck here and do not pursue a 4-year degree. This is a “hotspot” for college dropouts. Therefore, residents remain in their same class. It is not because Latinx parents aren’t active in their children’s education, but because students have other stresses and responsibilities that come with being low income that permit the cycle of remaining lower than others in class possible.
