Jim’s Western Wear is an iconic shop owned by Pablo Solis who started working there at 15 as a security guard and gradually worked his way up to manager, and then owner. Pablo immigrated to California from Chihuahua, Mexico at the age of 7. Jim’s prides itself on customer satisfaction, which is why their customers travel from all over the surrounding area. Jim’s is the best place to buy quality cowboy hats and boots, a western look worn by many Mexican Americans in San Fernando, a community of “little farms near the city,” (Carpio and Rutkowski) historically. The Solis family has been a part of the fabric of this community and many expressed their grief over Pablo’s passing in April 2020. (SFVS, 2020) His legacy and the store continue to be carried on by his son Macros Solis, who manages the store with the help of his mother and sisters.
