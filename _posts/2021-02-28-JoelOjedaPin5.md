The Echo Park Clubhouse is one of LA's oldest recreational buildings. Built in 1908, it has seen various groups and community organizations gather at the venue to be involved and shape their community. (Fisher) The vast number of community organizations that share a history with the Clubhouse testifies to the multiculturalism and inclusivity of Echo Park as a suburb, which is unique for its history of racial and class diversity. Several notable groups include the Echo Park Mothers club, North Eastern LA Lions Club, Echo Park Women's Club as well as many others. (“Echo”) The consistent flow of creative exchange between groups in conjunction with the Clubhouse being one of the few recreational buildings in Echo Park had led to a developing cosmopolitan ethos among varying racial and cultural populations, similar to Wendy Cheng's description from East of East (Cheng) The Echo Park Clubhouse still stands as one of Echo Parks pillars of community and diversity.
