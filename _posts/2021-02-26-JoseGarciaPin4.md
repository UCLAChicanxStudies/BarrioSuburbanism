Wal-Mart neighborhood market is located at the northwest corner of the community boundaries since 2012. The historic 19th century building is highly visible from the freeway, characterized by its large grain silo which was used in the early 20th century as a grain processing plant (Mannes). For decades the site was home to El Bazar, an indoor shopping center, similar to El Mercadito in Boyle Heights. In 2012 Wal-Mart was criticized for using aggressive tactics to demolish the historic building such as overturning a city council measure that would require an economic impact study to be performed, a study residents feel would have prevented construction (Hieu Tran Phan 1). This manipulation of permits shows the rising levels of gentrification in the community which is rapidly pricing out many Latinx/Chicanx families and businesses away. A case study of the rise in ethnoburbs across the country as gentrification, introduces and displaces certain groups (Carpio, slide 21).
