The packing house was built in 1922 in Claremont by the College Heights Orange and Lemon Association. For decades, it was Claremont’s top employer and a major component of the city’s economy. In 1972, after the construction of freeways, College Heights closed and the packing house went into a period of decline. This is related to urban planning because with the placement of the freeways, the packing house received much less business. This resulted in a loss of jobs for a large portion of the Claremont economy. After the packing house sat vacant for years, the city of Claremont purchased and restored the packing house in 2007. Now it is once again an important part of Claremont’s economy, and a supplier of many jobs.
