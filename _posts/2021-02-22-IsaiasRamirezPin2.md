Fort MacArthur Community Center is a multi-use facility that overlooks the San Pedro beaches. The center provides recreational space to host parties, workshops, military functions, weddings, etc. Although the name states Community Center, Fort MacArthur C.C. seems to be centered for military personnel, particularly the Air Force. According to the Los Angeles Times, in 2008, approximately 40% of San Pedro's population was Latina/o. However, in more recent times, the Statistical Atlas reports that 47% of the population is now Latina/o, showing us a constant Latinx migration rate into San Pedro. Moreover, the Statistical Atlas also shows the people living around the community center is majorly Latinx, second-highest being white folk; Latinx folk make up "78.7%" of its residents while white folk makes up "17.4%". Nevertheless, the substantial amount of Latinx folk around For MacArthur Community Center solidifies Latinas and Latinos' contribution to the United States Military.
