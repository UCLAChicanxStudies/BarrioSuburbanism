The Logan Barrio is squeezed between Santa Ana’s railroad tracks and the Santa Ana 5 Freeway. Chicano families have inhabited the Logan Barrio and claimed it as their own, making it a space of community. Past and current residents hold a reunion every year to come together and share histories of the barrio. Logan “was zoned for industrial use in 1923. But Latinos have lived there since the early 1900s” (Schwartz). Since then, residents have had to constantly fight to keep their homes. For example, Downtown Santa Ana and the Logan Barrio were considered “blighted areas” in the 1970’s as barrio residents resided in older “hodgepodge architectural style” housing (Londoño 124). In “Suburban Renewal”, González says city planners, in order to secure renewal funds, were ”required to define the area as blighted” to start rezoning neighborhoods (115). Despite the city’s consistent call for rezoning “blighted” Logan Barrio, the residents resisted the destruction of their homes by mobilizing.
