Evergreen Cemetery was established in 1877 and is a site that reflects the multiethnic and diverse history of Boyle Heights. The cemetery is “ segregated by ethnicity, with separate sections established for African Americans and early residents of Chinese, Mexican, Japanese, and Armenian descent, and members of the Jewish faith” (LA Conservancy). Boyle Heights became one of the most diverse neighborhoods in the United States until the end of World War II. The Eastside of Los Angeles was a space where the working-class and a variety of ethnic groups settled because of segregation and zoning policies. Local officials and government action enacted racial segregation through the real estate industry, in the form of restrictive covenants in the Westside of Los Angeles, which meant that the “area west of downtown Los Angeles was marked as middle class and a zone of whiteness” (Sanchez, 635). The community of Boyle Heights experienced “the wartime relocation of Japanese Americans, a postwar exodus of Jews, a concomitant movement of ethnic Mexicans from Watts and South Central Los Angeles, and a steady stream of braceros eventually left Boyle Heights less multicultural and more Mexican than it had been at the beginning of World War II.” (Gonzalez, 58). Evergreen Cemetery is a representation of all the ethnic and religious groups coinciding in a space that they were forced to reside in because they were nonwhite and working-class.
