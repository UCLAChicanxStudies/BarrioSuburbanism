Lincoln Heights witnessed residential segregation in the early 1950s as “suburban Los Angeles led to the expansion of Eastside barrios,” the population of residents with Spanish- surnames doubled between 1950 and 1960 (Gonzalez, 136). The Church of the Epiphany, Los Angele’s oldest Episcopal, seen Lincoln Heights transform from a predominantly Anglo community to now being predominantly Mexican. This place of worship was a focal point in the Chicano Movement as it became a meeting ground for Chicano activists. The church’s basement served as the birthplace of La Raza newspaper and made space for the Brown Berets to organize. The church provided a safe space for its community and its leaders were strong supporters of the movement even though they “did not share the community’s culture, or even their religious background (most Mexicans and Mexican Americans are Roman Catholics)” (Jao, 2018). The fathers assisted with leading protesters during marches and voiced their support for the movement.
