Built around the 1900s, the Interstate 5 stretches from the border (San Ysidro) all the way up north to Washington. Interstate 5 is known as one of the busiest highways in the country as it has permitted mass migration from city to city. This interstate is also important as it permits migrants coming from the border to travel north and up the state of California. As the highway reaches the city of Santa Ana, it can also be known as the Santa Ana Freeway. This highway is important for the Latino working class of Santa Ana for it allows them to travel to other parts of Southern California for work. Author Singer writes, “Construction of new or improved roads and highways to accommodate the thousands of cars and trucks that were regularly traversing both urban and rural parts of the country added to the efficacy of intra-urban linkages connecting several cities and suburbs” (Singer, 35).
