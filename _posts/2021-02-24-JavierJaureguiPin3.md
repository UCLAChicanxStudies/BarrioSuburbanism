On the north portion of MacArthur Park stands a sculpture entitled Why We Immigrate / Porque Emigramos elaborted by the Salvadoran artist Dagoberto Reyes. Reyes’ sculpture is part of a larger project organized by El Rescate, an organization dedicated to serving the Central American immigrant community in the area. This project consists of commemorating the lives of Salvadoran immigrants who arrived and settled in the surrounding area of MacArthur Park. The sculpture depicts the harsh realities of the journey that many Salvadoran immigrants have gone through to make it to Los Angeles. The project involves the task of gathering photographs, books, art, newspaper articles, etc. and placing them in the time capsule built adjacent to Dagoberto’s sculpture (quijada). This time capsule will be opened in 2093 as a way to remind future generations of why Salvadorans immigrated to the area. What makes Dagoberto Reyes’ sculpture even more important to the Salvadoran community is that, according to Peter Sellars, is “the first permanent marker of the Salvadorian community in North America in the entire country” (Sellars, 12).
