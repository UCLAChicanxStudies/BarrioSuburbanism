The site functions as a gateway into the Boyle Heights community in both the literal and cultural sense. As one enters the east side, Musicians dressed in traditional charro uniforms congregate along Boyle Street because it is a prime source for interested customers to find them. As a shape-up site, it has contributed to the growing informal economy that an increasing number of immigrants made flourish over decades of settling in Los Angeles. Within the plaza is the Mariachi Plaza Metro Station with a direct route to downtown making it convenient for residents to access downtown jobs but residentially pushed out. There is also a large stone kiosk, donated by the state of Jalisco, and the bandstand where organized performances were held. Farmer’s markets have set up, bands perform, locals come to dance, and vendors set up booths. When empty, the neighborhood youth gather there to skate or socialize.
