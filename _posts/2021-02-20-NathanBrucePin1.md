The two Chula Vista locations have over 9,000 combined Google reviews, are rated 4.4 and 4.5 stars, and are so popular that it is common to see lines that go out of the door at both locations simultaneously despite being less than half a mile from one another (Google Maps). It is beloved by people from all cultures, showing the tremendous appreciation for Mexican cuisine that exists in the San Diego area, attracting customers from all over the county (“Chula Vista Taco Spot”). The tradition of Mexican-owned and operated food vendors serving predominantly Mexican communities dates back for as long as there have been urban barrios like Chula Vista (Diaz, 33), and establishments like Tacos El Gordo carry on this history to this day, but their food is now enjoyed by an even wider and more diverse audience.
