Within many barrios in Mexico, there are usually centros culturales in which they teach different classes such as dance or art, offer cultural programs for the family, and put on events for the community. Like those centers, this one does the same, serving the Latinx community of Santa Ana in 1994, putting on events such as the annual Noche de Altares and offering classes such as ballet folklorico and danza mesoamericana. As I read A People’s Guide to Los Angeles, I could not help but think to myself what effects the publication of something like this, but highlighting Santa Ana could do for the community and halt the erasure occurring. A prominent community organization such as El Centro Cultural de México could lead these efforts and highlight the importance of the Latinx presence in the area.
