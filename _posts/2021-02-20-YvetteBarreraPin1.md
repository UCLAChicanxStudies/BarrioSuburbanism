The Fiesta Marketplace was a 12-million dollar project planned by Santa Ana developers to revive downtown Santa Ana. The development project had a target audience of both Anglo office workers and first-generation immigrants who worked or lived in the downtown area (Young). The marketplace, located along east 4th Street and Spurgeon, had a range of Latinx owned restaurants, bakeries, and other businesses. Although some businesses located along 4th street were displaced due to the project construction, the project developers themselves were immigrant business owners and Santa Ana natives (Schwartz). Despite the space originally intending to be inclusive for the Latinx residents, it was eventually renamed and redeveloped into “East End Promenade” in 2011 (Galvin). It removed the plaza carousel, tables, and painted over the vibrant cultural colors with neutrals. Latinx owned businesses and restaurants still remain along 4th Street, but it no longer advertises itself as a space for families or immigrants.
