Interstate 5 cuts right through the middle of Logan Heights it connects with the Coronado bridge, Interstate 15 and California SR 94. These junctions are densely concentrated within the community. Due to the urban planning initiatives after WWII, which included the freeway, the Logan population decreased from 20,000 to roughly 5,000 as a result (Robles & Del Castillo). Labeled a redlined zone due to its large Latino population, Logan and its surrounding neighborhoods were bordered off by the freeway system, this created disparities in wealth and resources depending on which side of the freeway one resided on. SR 94 for example works in a similar fashion to interstate 10 in Los Angeles, where the histories and voices on one side of the freeway are largely ignored by map politics (Carpio slide 8) Similarly, the voices and histories of the Latinx community in Barrio Logan have been historically ignored due to mapping,freeways and zoning laws.

Due to the few bridges connecting both sides of the freeway, the city implemented 3 narrow pedestrian bridges, 2 of which have no disability access due to poles or large staircases. Source: 2018 Google Street View of 30th St. & Newton Ave @32.694,-117.129. Google Maps, 2020.
