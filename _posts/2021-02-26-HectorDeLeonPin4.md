Originally named with the Indigenous name “Pachappa”, Mt. Rubidoux was named after a wealthy Riverside resident, and a cross was placed at the top and dedicated to a controversial religious pastor, Father Juniper Serra. Modern Riverside was evidently based in settler-colonialism, and is reflected in the image of vandalism. The conflict between caucasin settlers, Indigenous communities, and Latinx populations reflects the history of Southern California as a whole, and is seen in Mt. Rubidoux.
Today the cross atop of this mountain is a symbol of unity across cultures and faiths. The largest outdoors Easter Sunday Service occurs here every year, uniting Christians and Catholics to celebrate their faith in holiday. Riverside has a strong Latinx-Catholic presence and population. As seen in the book “Mexican Beverly Hills” religion is a strong unifier in a developing community. Latinxs here utilize the shared belief in Christ to facilitate their sense of belonging to greater Riverside.
