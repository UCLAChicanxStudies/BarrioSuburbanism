Located along the side of the railroads on Slauson, it is one of the many murals that can be seen on Slauson. A strong image of a woman taking a selfie is seen with the words South Central Dreams. South Central is undoubtedly one of the most dangerous places in the country but yet it is home to some of the most amazing people. With those amazing people come amazing dreams that often are not in reach due to the lack of opportunities presented. The dream is not dead though and every day South Central becomes a more beautiful place with more beautiful people.
