Interstate 10, a highway known for its progression from the west coast all the way across the country. Particularly, since its adoption in California around 1958, the highway has served as a mode of transportation for many, including Hispanic migrants seeking more open space, far away from the condensed inner cities. Moreover, the Inland Empire (Ontario) attracted many Hispanic individuals seeking jobs due to its new booming economy and numerous job opportunities (Gorman & Connel, 2021). Interstate 10 served as that gateway that many Hispanic individuals needed to escape the competitive job market offered in the inner city (Singer, 12-13). Ontario saw a significant increase in Hispanic migration as a result of this new and faster route towards the less-populated Inland Empire. Essentially, the now Hispanic-dominant population of Ontario can be attributed to Interstate 10, making it easier for those to make Ontario what it is today-- a thriving and growing Hispanic-dominant population.
