According to the Daily Breeze, The Rancho San Pedro Housing Project was built close to the beach to accommodate defense industry workers whose jobs were located by the ports. It's also important to note that most of these jobs were held by white folk, making the general residents in the housing project white. Furthermore, the San Pedro History Project mentions a small community near West 1st Street and Vincent Thomas Bridge, bordering the housing projects, dubbed "Mexican Hollywood". Locals dubbed the area "Mexican Hollywood" because of the high concentration of Mexican-Americans living in that space compared to the greater San Pedro area, which was mostly white folk. Moreover, according to the Statistical Atlas, approximately 62% of the Rancho San Pedro Housing Project residents are now Latinx. Thus, the community that formed "Mexican Hollywood" changed San Pedro's culture and possibly served as a gateway for other Latinx folk to come in.
