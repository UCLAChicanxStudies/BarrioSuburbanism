Xevichez Sushi Bar in Sylmar California is notable for being the first sushi bar in Sylmar. Xevichez offers asian cuisine and blends it with Mexican dishes and ambiance. Always alive with music, anyone who lives here can depend on it to have a fun time with good food with upscale quality without the travel and price. Xevichez has cultivated a sense of community with most locals knowing the chefs personally and employing tons of Sylmar residents as hostesses/waitresses. In Barrios to Burbs we see how entrepreneurship plays a role in the success of some individuals like it has here for the owner of Xevichez who now has expanded in 2 more locations and been able to blend latino culture into areas where it isn’t as popularized like the suburbs of Santa Clarita Valley.
