Every week, the city of Huntington Park hosts a Certified Farmers’ Market. This market provides a space in which farmers are able to sell their fresh produce directly to Huntington Park residents, making these products more accessible to the city’s largely Latinx population. The market also caters to its Latinx community by selling Mexican and Salvadoran foods (“Wednesday - Huntington Park”). The Farmers’ Market at the Salt Lake Park is one example of how Latinx individuals may build community within neighborhood spaces and thus build solidarity. It is an example of how the Latinx community may claim public spaces to serve them in their efforts towards cultural reinvigoration (“Chapter Six: We Can’t Forget Our Roots”).
