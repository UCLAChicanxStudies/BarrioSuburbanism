The non-profit Barrio Station has redirected Barrio Logan’s youth away from gang activity. The facility offers gymnasiums, a boxing ring, a recreational center, and a hall for events. Additionally the financial assistance initiatives have paid for textbooks, eyeglasses, and free lunches for its members as well as tattoo and scar removal surgeries (Alfonso 1). Rachel Ortiz founded the center 50 years ago after volunteering for the UFW in San Francisco (Villafaña 1). Ortiz’s approach of redirecting youth into sports and recreational activities is reminiscent of Father Coffield’s initiatives at Hicks Camp. Father Coffield organized sport leagues for boys that kept them away from drug abuse and gangs during the Zoot Suit riots (González 37). In recent years as gang activity has declined and gentrification increased, the center has shifted focus to protecting the youth and their families from getting displaced from the community (Villafaña 1).
