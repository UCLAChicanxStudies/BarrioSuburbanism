Casa Blanca Mexican Restaurant was opened by Blanca Hinojos in 1979 and it has been thriving ever since, especially in recent years. Gale Avenue, the street on which Casa Blanca resides, is one of the main streets in Hacienda Heights. Its geographical location helped increase the restaurant’s clientele base and expose it to other ethnic demographics. Since Hacienda Heights is home to a large Latino/x population, the restaurant originally gained business through this community, but since the 2000s it has attracted a larger client base of non-Latinx people from the surrounding affluent neighborhoods. Although Casa Blanca has become a hallmark of the city for its Mexican cuisine, its story parallels that of several other Hispanic immigrant residents in Hacienda Heights who also opened a small business in efforts to gain economic mobility. Oftentimes, immigrants struggled to find work due to language barriers and their undocumented status (Singer, 3).
