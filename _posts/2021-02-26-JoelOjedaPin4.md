Southern California during the1920s witnessed different developers and architects attempt to encapsulate the “Californian goodlife” by using historical and indigenous motifs like Spanish Colonial and American Indian architecture. (Kuzins) The Atwater Bungalows are one example of this trend; designed by Robert Stacy-Judge and commissioned by Dr. H Gale Atwater, he had been inspired by the idea of the peaceful Hopi tribe and bought several plots of land to emulate it through tenants. (Foster) The Bunglaows, like many other pre-columbian and Colonial style developments of the time, had been marketed as living the good life as the Conquistadors which Ironically still included the isolation of Mexican and other historical agents from these spaces (Kropp) Although Atwaters Bungalows proved to be a financial disaster due to its high construction cost and rent, its construction shares a connection to other similar developments of the time which implemented racial covenants and segregation.
