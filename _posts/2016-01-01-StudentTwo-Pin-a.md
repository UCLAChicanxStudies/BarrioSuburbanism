Rosemead was incorporated in 1959 and is situated in the San Gabriel Valley bordering other inner-ring suburbs such as Monterey Park and South El Monte. Rosemead’s Asian and Latina/o populations have increased considerably in the past century due to factors such as weakening legal and social segregation, increases in immigration rates into suburbs rather than urban areas, and white flight (Diaz). Rosemead is part of the land inhabited by the Tongva before the conquest by the Spanish and the creation of the San Gabriel Mission whose iconographic echoes can be seen in Rosemead and the surrounding San Gabriel Valley (Rosemead Chamber of Commerce). Rosemead was part of the historical “citrus belt” that employed multiethnic populations including Asian and Latina/o populations which is tied into the current demographic makeup of the suburb (Garcia 26). Its restaurant and business sectors are a part of the built landscape that mirror the multiethnic histories that this suburb is built upon.
