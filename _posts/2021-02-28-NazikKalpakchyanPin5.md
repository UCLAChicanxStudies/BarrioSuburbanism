Glendale Community College is a public community college in Glendale, California. GCC offers a broad range of degree and certificate programs and has a diverse faculty and student body. For example, in 2018, GCC housed 3,856 Latino and Hispanic students. Furthermore, in 2018, 24% of GCC's full-time faculty was composed of Latino and Hispanic staff members. GCC also offers a Chicano studies program that focuses on the "social, political, religious values, literary heritage, cultural attributes, and experiences of Hispanic Americans" (Glendale Community College 2021). The diversity in GCCs programs and faculty/student body is significant because historically, students of color in the U.S faced discrimination in school environments. For example,  Latinx students' capabilities were questioned as they were considered to "lag behind in academics" (Cheng 2013, 63). Furthermore, Latinx students in the U.S. were subject to segregation and neglect by teachers (Deverell 2005, 154). Therefore, through its inclusivity, GCC mitigates the historical discrimination faced by students of color and diversifies Glendales schooling as a result.
