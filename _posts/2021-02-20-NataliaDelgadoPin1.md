California High School is the largest high school in the city of Whittier, CA. The student population consists of nearly 90% Latino and 76% of its students are socioeconomically disadvantaged (wuhsd.org). Nevertheless, more than half of the students enrolled have a GPA of 3.0 or higher (wuhsd.org). I would consider this school model to be more similar to the Los Angeles school model that we studied in class, as opposed to the Chicago school model. This school has many different clubs and activities for students to participate in, and a lot of them revolve around the Latino/a/e identity (wuhsd.org). This is one of four public high schools in the city of Whittier, and it is located closest to the Friendly Hills suburb. Although the city of Whittier is moderately diverse, but with a higher Latino/a/e population, a large portion of the Latinos reside in Friendly Hills.
