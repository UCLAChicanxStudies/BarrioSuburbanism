St. John Vianney Catholic Church has been a pivotal religious institution in shaping Hacienda Heights. It is located on Turnbull Canyon Road which used to be flooded by orange and lemon groves before Hacienda Height was incorporated. A large Latinx population gravitated to the city because they wanted to live near a Catholic Church offering Spanish mass as religion tends to be an integral part of the Latinx identity. This made it easier for immigrant families to resist assimilation. St. John Vianney helped create a community where Latinx/Hispanic families have found a sense of comfort and belonging throughout the decades. This Church also has helped many low-income parishioners by holding food bank events. This has aided the economic mobility of Latinx residents in Hacienda Heights (Vallejo 3). The Church was destroyed by an arson fire in 2011 and the Hispanic community took extensive efforts to ensure its reconstruction.
