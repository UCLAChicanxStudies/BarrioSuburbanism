Santa Ana College (SAC) “was the second junior college founded in Orange County” (“History of Santa Ana College”). It held its first classes among Santa Ana High School students before its college campus was constructed in 1947. SAC has their own Chicano Studies department and is home to a student group called MeChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán). MeChA and other Chicano students in Santa Ana have participated in community organizing, protested with Brown Berets against police brutality, and led school walkouts to protest discrimination in public schools (Londoño 122). As a result, the Santa Ana police force developed a riot training program to respond against their activism. However, the police response just “facilitated the construction of a cohesive political identity” for the Chicano activist students (González 85). Student protesters were even compared to the civilians inciting the East LA riots at the time.
