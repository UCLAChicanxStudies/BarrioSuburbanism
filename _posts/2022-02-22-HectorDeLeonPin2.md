Located in Bobby Bonds Park, in Riverside’s “Eastside”, and neighboring the Cesar Chavez Community Center, the Johnny Martin Sotelo Youth Opportunity Center. Named after Riverside’s first Latino Councilmember, the center is a testament to the self-sufficiency, resilience, and resourcefulness prevalent in the Latinx community of Riverside’s Eastside. 

This space and its multiple programs focuses on providing support for youth aged 14-22. As described, there are programs available such as “fine arts classes, tutoring, community service opportunities, spring and summer camps, computer and internet access, Project BRIDGE gang intervention and prevention program, alternative education programs, among others. The YOC cultivates a safe and positive environment for its local youth.” In the absence of institutional support, the community banded together to provide its future to support BIPOC in pursuing education, employment, and empowerment.
