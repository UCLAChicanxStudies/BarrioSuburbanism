The North Hollywood Swapmeet represents the “ethnically distinct character of the barrio” surrounding it (Diaz, 2005, p. 33). Latinx families can purchase quinceañera dresses, “recuerdos”, and medicine from their home countries which are seldom found elsewhere in the area. One customer states, “I find everything I need from polos to slides and all the essentials for Mexican life!” (C. J., 2017) The flea market serves as a space of resistance to monolingual American establishments as mostly Spanish speaking vendors own and/or run the small shops. The swapmeet resembles the “tianguis” in Latin American countries where families buy essential and affordable items. Lopez (2020) describes the swapmeet as a “nostalgic vibe” where you can “bargain” and find “fair, cheap prices” while shopping for “all in one place”.  The flea market directly competes with Euro-American businesses as they offer a variety of services, such as personal care, ethnic products, and even auto maintenance (Diaz, 2005, p. 33).
