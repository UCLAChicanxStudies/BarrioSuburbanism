Located in front of Two Guys Plaza in Los Angeles, A  food market that started from one single vendor has now become part of Los Angelesâ€™ tradition with many vendors selling products from Central America, in particular El Salvador. With the plaza having the only location of the Salvadoran national bank and other Salvadoran souvenir shops the plaza was already a Salvadoran hot spot when local vendors saw the opportunity and made it into a food market traditionally seen in El Salvador. The products available range from fresh fruits and cheeses to already made traditional dishes. With all the services available one can send money to their family, buy souvenirs, and buy delicious food in the span of twenty minutes.
