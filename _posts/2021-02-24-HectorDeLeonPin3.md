Artist Martin Sanchez (owner of Tio’s Tacos) immigrated to Riverside with his family at a young age from Michoacan, Mexico in 1984. Martin created 300 butterflies out of recycled materials he kept over the years (the same materials used for his restaurant). His persistence for sustainability holds to be a reflection of sustainability activism in Latinx culture.

Located between Riverside City Hall, and the Riverside Courthouse, these butterflies are a reflection of his immigration story, and the countless stories of other latinxs and immigrant families in the community. These butterflies symbolize the City of Riverside itself. Historically, Riverside was developed through agriculture, which was an industry powered by Asian and Latinx immigrant farmworkers.
