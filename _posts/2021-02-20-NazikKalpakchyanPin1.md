"Adelante! Mexican American Artists: 1960's and Beyond" was a temporary art exhibit at the Forest Lawn Museum in Glendale, California. The artworks displayed the history, culture, and discrimination faced by Mexican Americans. For example, Mark Vallens's painting, "La Causa," depicted a teenage girl dressed in the uniform of a Chicano militant group who rebelled against social and political injustices (Martin 2011). Mexican Americans faced many forms of discrimination in the U.S, one being the Federal Housing Administrations' appraisals of predominantly Mexican neighborhoods as areas with "No pride of ancestry or hope for prosperity" (Gonzalez 2017, 21). The City of Glendale also practiced these exclusions as deed restrictions limited homeownership to white residents (Bonnell 1987). Hence, Vallens paintings depicted a period in history where people of color demanded social change. What's significant is these artworks, which symbolically represent Mexican Americans' struggle, were placed in a community that once discriminated against these peoples. Therefore, the presence of these works expanded the knowledge of Glendale's residents about a racist history that their community contributed to.
