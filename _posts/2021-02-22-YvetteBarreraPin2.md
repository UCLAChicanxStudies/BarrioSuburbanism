The Yost Theater used to screen Mexican films and host concerts by Mexican artists like Pedro Infante (Delson). The theater closed in 1985, but developer Irving Chase took interest in renovating and reopening the theater. The renovation was said to draw in more customers to businesses among the theater on 4th Street. Since 1985, the theater has closed and reopened multiple times for renovations. It has now scrapped it’s previous Spanish Colonial architecture for the modern Art Deco aesthetic (Chang). The Spanish Colonial style was “dubbed the most appropriate one for the region” by Southern California architects, but it also romanticized and erased the history of the Latinx population, making them relics of the past (Kropp 167). Not only is Spanish Colonial aesthetic erased at the Yost, but the theater has erased it’s connection with the Latino community as it is currently advertised as an attractive venue space for private events.
