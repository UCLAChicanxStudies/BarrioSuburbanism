Salsa and Beer remains the most popular restaurant for Mexican food in North Hollywood. Salsa and Beer is widely recognized due to its established clientele and favorable reviews. Several customers claim it is their “favorite restaurant,” and has “some of the best Mexican food in the Valley” (Celine T., 2020; Watkins, 2019).  Every weekend a line wraps around the restaurant. Celine T. (2020) reasons that the restaurant “deserves 5 stars but I gave them 4” because waiting can be “close to two hours” and finding parking can be difficult. Salsa and Beer continues to resist gentrification of North Hollywood and symbolizes the large Mexican community, who compose 57 percent of the surrounding neighborhood (Social Explorer, n.d.). In fact, two more restaurants were opened in the area to accommodate for the demand. Salsa and Beer competes with Euro-American establishments, as it offers authentic “Mexican products and speciality food” and provides “Spanish speaking service” (Diaz, 2005, p. 33).
