The land, which is now known as Lincoln Park, was to be a maintenance shop for Southern Pacific Railroad; however, Southern Pacific returned the land to the city to build a public park for suburban East Los Angeles since the space was unused. The park attracted guests with its boathouse and the city’s first zoo. As the east of Los Angeles became the one nation’s largest barrio, “ethnic Mexicans crafted their own sense of the suburban ideal, which included activities for collective protection and advancement… especially for the youth, practices in public space that marked these areas as culturally distinct suburbs” (Gonzalez 6). In the 1970s, the park’s once-neglected boathouse became home to Plaza de la Raza, a cultural and community arts center and art gallery. The center has served Eastside neighborhoods of Los Angeles for the past 50 years and has provided education classes for adults and affordable art education programs to local youth.
