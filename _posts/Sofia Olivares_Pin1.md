Located in Downtown Santa Ana, The Yost Theatre opened in 1912 where Latinx visitors were originally racially segregated and forced to sit in balconies away from white audience members (Gonzales 45). After Lewis Olivos Sr. bought the theater in 1952, the Yost began celebrating Latino art and culture despite the city’s relatively small Latinx population at that time. Residents were able to enjoy performances from Latinx singers and dancers or even meet Latinx celebrities such as Vicente Fernandez and Juan Gabriel (McLellan). The Yost Theatre was a major representation of Latinx culture for decades until it was sold in 1985. Recently, the Yost Theatre has been renovated into a multi-purpose event space that no longer showcases Latinx productions (Chang). This is part of a larger process happening throughout Downtown Santa Ana and other cities in the country to “modernize” businesses and attract a different clientele, erasing the Latinx influence that was prominent in the area (Pulido et al. 82).
