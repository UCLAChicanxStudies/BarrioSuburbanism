desc: "Although Valley Plaza did not become a grand mall of the San Fernando Valley, it served as a crucial space for a predominantly Latinx community."

Initially, Valley Plaza included several class A stores that would serve the mostly white suburb of North Hollywood. It became the second largest mall in the greater Los Angeles area and was among the first unified malls in the nation (Libby, 2003). However, Valley Plaza suffered from disinvestment due to an outmigration of white suburbanites and the 1990s recession (Pool, 2003). Meanwhile, the Latinx population grew in North Hollywood. By 1990, Latinxs composed about 60 percent of the population compared to less than 3 percent in 1950 (Social Explorer, n.d.). Loyal Latinx customers helped Sears remain the longest-standing store in the center, despite massive store closures (Wilcox 2016). For over 30 years, this Sears sold primarily to Latinx customers, who returned for their “blowout” sales. Today, Valley Plaza lies in a predominantly Latinx working-class community. Through processes of urban renewal, private investors seek to reclaim this space and modernize this “forgotten” mall (Diaz, 2005, p. 40).
