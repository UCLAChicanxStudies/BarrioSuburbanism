In 1939, Santa Ana built a new depot for their railroad transportation system called the Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center. The railroad was originally built among the Logan Barrio and connected the city of Santa Ana all the way to Los Angeles county and San Diego county. Farmers and agricultural workers in Orange County used railroads to ship a wide range of agricultural goods “which included citrus, walnuts and grains” (“Santa Ana, CA (SNA)”). A majority of the Chicanos living in Santa Ana at the time were employed as railroad workers and agricultural harvesters (Haas 48). The construction of the railroad provided labor to Mexican immigrants, but it also put Santa Ana on a fast track to attracting suburbanites as Haas says the population increased by 3,000 in the span of two years (50). The Suburb Reader notes, “railroad suburbs attracted businessmen and professionals, who could afford the cost of daily commuting” (Nicolaides and Weise 3).
