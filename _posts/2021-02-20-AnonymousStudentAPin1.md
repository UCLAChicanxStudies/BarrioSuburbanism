Attracted to housing and jobs, immigrants are increasing in suburbs, establishing a new gateway (Singer, 2008, p. 16). However, not every suburb warmly welcomes immigrants. In Temecula, immigrants are welcomed by a checkpoint on the I-15 North freeway. According to Srikrishnan (2020), Border Patrol may stop and search any individual within 100 miles from the US-Mexico border. This has created tensions between local law enforcement and the Latinx community due to a continued history of racial profiling and harsh interrogation (Gonzales, 2013, p. 92). Local law enforcement’s willingness to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) creates fear among the local Latinx community, regardless of legal status. Srikrishnan (2020) reports that increased ICE activity during the pandemic has instilled more fear among Latinx agricultural workers who must cross the checkpoint for work or to reach the local hospital. However, Alianza Comunitaria created a network to communicate with locals about checkpoints and advocate on their behalf.
