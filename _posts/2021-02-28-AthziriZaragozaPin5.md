After WWII, Boyle Heights began housing less ethnically diverse immigrants such as Russians, Japanese, and Jews and as a post-WWII gateway allowed them to funnel into suburbs, especially later generations. Latinx immigrants took over and by 1968, the East L.A. blowouts served to cast national attention on the school. The walkouts were organized by Chicanx students and activists in protest against racial and educational inequality in the U.S. and the enforced assimilation imposed by the schools such as punishments for speaking spanish. By organizing the huge demonstration the youth provided a significant catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement. Since then, the school continues to be a relevant community icon, especially for hosting the Classic. An annual football game between Roosevelt and Garfield High School, the rivalry invites everyone regardless of whether they belong to either school, attracting alumni, parents, students because residents most likely know someone attending Roosevelt.
