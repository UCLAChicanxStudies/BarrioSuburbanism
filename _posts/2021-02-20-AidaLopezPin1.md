 Located on N Broadway, Lincoln High School became a main focal point of the Chicano Movement, leading the wave of the high school walkouts of 1968. At the beginning of their Fall 1966 semester, high school students began to hold demonstrations to protest the inequalities Mexican American students were experiencing such as the lack of counseling services, educational tracking, and racist teachers and administrators. It is known that “schools mirror the class system of larger society and actively maintain class and racial or ethnic inequalities in education” (Vallejo, 58). This perpetuates the socioeconomic inequalities that are formed as a result of subpar schools being present in neighborhoods that have a history of being racially segregated. Tracking has been a consecutive “mechanism in which race, class, and gender intersect and which creates different opportunity structures that reproduce the racial hierarchy and exacerbate the education gap” through shaping the patterns of educational attainment among minorities (Vallejo, 62).
