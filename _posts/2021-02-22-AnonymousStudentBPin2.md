This California State Historical Park was named after an important figure in Chicano History; Pío de Jesus Pico. He was the governor of California in the 1800’s during the Mexican American war, and he was the last California governor of Mexican descent before the war (parks.ca.gov). The park was named after him because it was the area that he built his home in after he served as governor, which is present day Whittier and Pico Rivera. In the chapter 2 reading, Diaz writes “By the late 1800s, the parameters of the social construction of Chicana/o urban barrios had been set by the specific cultural, political, and economic histories of cities in the region” (Diaz, 2005). A site like this has a rich history of the formations of barrios in the Eastern Los Angeles area for the Latino community. People can go visit this location and learn more about its history.
