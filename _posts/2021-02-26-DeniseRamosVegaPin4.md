Not many movie theaters offer the luxury of films being dubbed in Spanish, but the Fiesta Twin Theater located in Santa Ana used to be the place to go to watch a movie in Spanish! Unfortunately, due to the gentrification that engulfed fourth street, they were forced to shut down and replaced by the “Frida Cinema” which typically airs indie films. If this does not scream gentrification, I do not know what does. Within “Barrios to Burbs”, Vallejo states: “A consistent problem in research on Mexican Americans is a lack of attention to issues of class and the ways in which class background affects different spheres of social life and mobility pathways” (4). The existing gentrification may benefit certain groups of Latinxs, but it does not benefit all and ends up taking away important features such as this theater which was the only one that offered films dubbed in Spanish.
