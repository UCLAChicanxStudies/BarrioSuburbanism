In 1923 Roosevelt High School (RHS) opened its doors to the diverse student community of Boyle Heights. RHS’s legacy of student activism traces back to 1945 with a protest of six hundred students after Gerald L. K. Smith, a known facist, gave a speech at a neighborhing high school (Sanchez, 641). RHS is more popularly known for its contribution in the organization of the East L.A. Walkouts of 1968. The walkouts by Chicanx students across schools in East Los Angeles in order to challenge racial and educational inequalities was key in the development of the Chicano Civil Rights Movement in the United States (L.A. Conservancy). Despite RHS’s achievements and activist culture, the media decides to portray it as a drop out factory and undermine the potential of its student body. Chicanx students in the Southwest have long endured educational discrimination due to their English language skills as Spanish heritage speakers (Hurtado, 2019).
