---
North Hollywood High School lies in a predominantly white residential area in North Hollywood. Despite its location, the student body reflects the large Latinx population in the area. According to the California Department of Education, in 2019, Latinx students composed 66.3 percent of the population followed by 17.5 percent of white students. The school houses two magnet programs and three smaller learning communities. These programs reflect “class systems” in society and “actively maintain class and racial or ethnic inequalities in education” (Vallejo, 2012, p. 58). For example, Asian and white students constituted about 70 percent of those admitted into the Highly Gifted Magnet, meanwhile only 15.4 percent of Latinx students were enrolled (Los Angeles Unified School District, n.d.). Essentially, these programs reinforce an “achievement gap” and construct Asian and white students as inherently “high achievers” and Latinx students students as “academically deficient” (Cheng, 2013, p. 71). In turn, disregarding structural inequalities.
