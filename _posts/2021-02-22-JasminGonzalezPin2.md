The Huntington Park Warner Theatre originally opened in the 1930s. It was redeveloped in the 1980s and catered to Huntington Park’s large Latino population by running films in Spanish or with Spanish subtitles. It later closed in the 1990s and was eventually sold; it was briefly a Blink Fitness location before being put back on the market (“Huntington Park Warner Theatre”). Though the theatre is now closed, it remains a permanent fixture within the community and holds historical significance for Huntington Park residents. This theatre has played a role in the lived experiences of its Latino community, just as Latinos “impacted the economic, social, and spatial contours” of the Warner Theatre (Carpio and Rutkowski) by having it cater to their community’s needs.
