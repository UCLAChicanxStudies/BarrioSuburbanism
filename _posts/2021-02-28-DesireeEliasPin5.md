This Smart & Final used to be the Community and Mission Hospital of Huntington Park until it was closed due to a budget crisis. The closure of this hospital shows one of the many issues that low income communities of color suffer, such as “stifling poverty, and lack of access to educational and health resources” (Gonzalez, 2018). While its sister hospital remains open less than 10 minutes away, the closure of the hospital was a major loss for the city. The hospital's closure was “a serious blow not only to the community, which will lose access to these vital services, but to devoted caregivers who will lose their jobs” (Savage, 2008). The hospital was replaced with Smart and Final, which also led to the closing of a small Latino supermarket across the street called El Tapatio.
