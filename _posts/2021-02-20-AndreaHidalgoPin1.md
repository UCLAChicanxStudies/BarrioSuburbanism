El Cariso Community Regional Park is a recreational park located in Sylmar California. This park has offered members of the community a place to play sports, lounge and host small gatherings. It homes basketball, tennis, and handball courts as well a football field and a junior olympic sized pool. Along with that there are playgrounds and other open fitness areas throughout the park.  “El Cariso Park stands as a memorial to the young men who lost their lives in the Loop Fire on November 1, 1966.” (la county.gov).  This park provides a safe place for children with its variety of organized sports programs. It is a place that is always alive with activity and music. Housed in a predominantly latino community, this park represents the so called dream of “weekends spent cruising in the minivan shuttling between little league games and swimming lessons” (Vallejo 13).
