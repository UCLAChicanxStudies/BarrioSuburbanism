Old Town is Temecula’s present downtown district. In 1882, the California Southern Railroad line was constructed and shifted the center of Temecula to present-day Old Town (Brigandi, n.d.). Saloons, stores, and hotels welcomed incoming travellers; and some of these historic buildings still stand alongside new establishments, making Old Town one of Temecula’s most popular attractions. It also hosts the annual Rod Run, a two-day event that allows individuals to showcase and cruise their classic cars on Main Street. In particular, Chicanos from the area display their lowriders. Since the 1960s, lowriding and cruising have been important to Chicano culture because it allowed for “autonomous expression” and ”cultural power” in suburban public spaces (Gonzalez, 2018). Opposite of the police oppression faced by Chicano cruisers in Southeast Los Angeles during the 1960s, this event welcomes lowriders and allows the attendees to appreciate them (Gonzalez, 2018).
