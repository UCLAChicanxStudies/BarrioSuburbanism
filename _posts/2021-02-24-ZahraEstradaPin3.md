After moving to Long Beach from Rochester, New York, William Phillips met his wife Hannah in Boyle Heights and settled there once they got married in 1933. He opened the Phillips Music Company store in 1936 and would sell and record “Jewish Melodies” and “Musica Mexicana” (Tobar, 2011). Phillips was the first treasurer for Edward Roybal’s City Council campaign, who would go on to “become the first elected Mexican American city council member in Los Angeles since the nineteenth century” (Gonzalez, 76). When Japanese-Americans were released from the internment camps and many returned to Boyle Heights, among them Kenji Taniguchi, Phillips offered a section of his store so that Taniguchi could open his sporting goods business in the 1950s (Sanchez, 645). The Jewish community in Boyle Heights’ support of Mexicans and Mexican Americans is demonstrated through people like William Phillips, who would let Latino musicians spend time inside his store and introduce them to other musicians around Los Angeles. In 1949, William Phillips moved out of Boyle Heights but kept his store there until the 1990s. His son, Bruce, states that redlining and the construction of the 5 Freeway resulted in the exodus of Jews, Japanese-Americans, and working-class people as they were forced out of their neighborhood (Tobar, 2011). The Phillips Music Co. represents how multicultural and multiethnic/multiracial Boyle Heights was and how these different groups worked together. The surroundings of Boyle Heights transformed as Jews and Japanese-Americans moved across L.A. and the Latinx population increased to form 95% of the community.
