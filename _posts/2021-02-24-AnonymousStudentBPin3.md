Although Whittier Boulevard in its entirety is not located in only Whittier, California, it actually is a very recognizable road for those who reside in the Eastern parts of the Los Angeles area. It is a location that comes to mind when discussing the Chicano Movement of the late 1960’s, where it was an overall common place to spot the Chicano community cruising in low riders and hanging out (Del Barco, 2018). The musical group Thee Midniters made their hit song “Whittier Blvd.” based on this area. In chapter 2 of the Diaz reading, the author touches on the events that lead up to the Chicano movement, and a lot of the people living in those barrios at the time were of Mexican descent. He talks about how people started to move towards the Eastern parts of the LA area, which is probably how Whittier Boulevard became so known in the community.
