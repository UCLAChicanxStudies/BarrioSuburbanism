The Latino Family Center provides health services such as substance abuse counseling, crisis intervention, individual counseling, and family therapy to residents in Montebello and the greater San Gabriel Valley. The California Hispanic Commission Alcohol and Drug Abuse (CHCADA) aided in establishing this center for the purposes of helping disadvantaged Latinos in the area (“Outpatient Treatment”). By providing health services at a low-cost the Latino Family Center is providing additional aid to the twenty-two percent of Montebello residents who have difficulty accessing healthcare (Los Angeles County, 2018, pp.24). By providing access to healthcare that is targeted towards the Latinx community, the Latino Family Center plays a direct role in the upward economic mobility. Furthermore, the center tackles issues that tend to be overlooked such as mental health issues or substance abuse. It’s worth noting that many suburbs tend to be dominated by blue-collar and ethnic workers, who are the most vulnerable to such issues (Nicolaides & Wiese, 2006).
