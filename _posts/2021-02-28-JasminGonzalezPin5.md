Pacific Boulevard contains a large shopping district with mostly small-owned businesses and few mainstream retailers and restaurants. The appeal of this street has been its “preservation of a cultural past” (Vives), as it is home to several quinceañera and vaquero shops selling traditional Latin attire and many restaurants selling Latin American food. This street is also where the Carnaval Primavera, or spring festival, occurs; this festival is marketed as a “major Hispanic market” (“Carnaval Primavera”), complete with commercial booths, food, a health fair, live entertainment, amusement rides, and a special Latinx celebrity guest every year. 
Pacific Boulevard holds immense cultural significance for its Latinx community. By focusing on this cultural significance and centering attention on Huntington Park residents, we may appreciate the “ordinary and everyday” landscape which “offer[s] information about the practices and everyday life of the people currently using and inhabiting [this] place” (“Introduction”).
