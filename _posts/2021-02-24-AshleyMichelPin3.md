The Port of Los Angeles, located in the San Pedro Bay, is the busiest seaport in the Western Hemisphere, processing approximately $300 billion worth of trade every year.1 

Despite this immense wealth, the Harbor Area of Los Angeles has suffered from heightened risk of respiratory illness due to heavy diesel traffic traveling to and from the ports.2 Like the colonias of early Latine suburban settlement, this area has suffered from disinvestment and environmental racism. 

In response, community advocacy groups like the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy and the Coalition for a Safe Environment fought for the Clean Trucks Program, which mandates that all diesel vehicles passing through the Ports must be model year 2014 or newer. Already, this policy has resulted in a 90% reduction in diesel emissions.3 LAANE’s Port campaign also works towards securing fair wages and standards for truck drivers, who are majority Hispanic and foreign-born and earn a median income of less than $30,000 annually.
