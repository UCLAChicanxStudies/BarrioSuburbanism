Located in one of the oldest Latino neighborhoods of Santa Ana, the Heroes Among Us mural is an artistic piece honoring Mexican American veterans who served during WWII or the Vietnam War. In 2012, artist Carlos Aguilar was studying graphic design at Saddleback College when he got the idea for this project. He reached out to the community and the owner of La Chiquita Market in the Logan Barrio not only agreed to donate his wall but he also helped with supplies. Community members also brought donations and photos of their relatives. This mural is a point of pride as local students and historians have used it as research by the Chicano Department of the community college of Santa Ana. As author Ochoa writes, “These public displays may be challenges to the dominant culture and forms of resistance against expectations of “appropriate” English language, middle-class, and Anglo centered public decorum” (Ochoa,157).
