The St. Matthias Church is one of the biggest churches in the city of Huntington Park. The Church also has a school that “provides service for children in the surrounding communities from preschool through eighth grade” (St. Matthias Dual Catholic School). There are many little churches around the city, but unlike in New Orleans where “the majority preferred to worship in dispersed parishes throughout the city”(Weise, 2008), this church attracts most of the Catholic residents in the city. This church used to cater to its predominantly white upper middle class residents in the early 1900s, and still stands regardless of class and racial change in the city. This Catholic church gathers many Hispanic members of the community for religious social gatherings. Most gatherings or religious events are done in Spanish to best fit the community, although mass is also available in English at certain times.
