El Pavo Bakery was opened by a Mexican immigrant named Don Pedro Vazquez (El Pavo Bakery, 2019). The bakery is family-run, and its biggest pride is supplying its customers with authentic Mexican bread and food. They offer their customers a large array of “pan dulce,” cakes, and tamales. Yearly, on the week of January 6, they also offer the traditional Mexican Catholic bread, Rosca de Reyes. Their founding in 1962 demonstrates that the 1960s and 1970s brought the increasing ethnic diversification and reemergence of large immigrant and multiethnic communities within formerly white suburbs (Nicolaides and Weise, 2006). As the Los Angeles Times remarks, “Mexican Americans began trickling into Glendale in the 1960s in search of the middle-class quiet, [and] safety...” (Texeira, 2000). Hence, Mr. Vazquez opened his bakery with the aim of obtaining middle-class status. In fact, the bakery found in Glendale, California is just one of five locations.
