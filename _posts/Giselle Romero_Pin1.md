South Gate has housed Maloney Meat Co since 1983. “Papa,” a nickname given to him by customers and employees, was a middle-class white man living in a majority Latinx community and he was aware. SG’s colonia-like characteristics include low-income, with suboptimal housing conditions and location adjacent to employment centers like sweatshops only 7 miles into DTLA. He brought resources to this “colonia” by employing residents of the city allowing them to provide for their families. He created a community space by not forcing Latinx to assimilate to white culture when buying from his meat market through the use of Spanish signage; we know from Vallejo that the first sign of linear assimilation is picking up the core group’s language. He embraced community religious beliefs by not only displaying the mural but hosting holiday festivities in honor of the Virgin Mary. Through this establishment, South Gate’s heart and core is represented.
