desc: "Lincoln Heights Jail sits right next to the Los Angeles River. This 5-story Art Deco jail operated for 34 years and was overwhelmingly crowded during it’s time. As of recent, this space has been sought over by potential developers and designers that want to make use of the property."

The construction of Lincoln Heights jail began in the late 1920s. This confinement facility opened in 1931 and was designed to hold 625 prisoners at full capacity. However, by the 1950s, the jail was overcrowded with 2,800 prisoners. In 1965 the jail closed due to overcrowding. Lincoln Heights community members suggested using the vacant space by proposing a “job training and industrial complex for unemployed Chicanos''; however it was not approved (Synderities, 2). The location housed the Bilingual Foundation of the Arts from 1979 to 2014. In 2017, 2 property companies were selected to redevelop the jail into the Lincoln Heights Makers District, which will consist of commercial and manufacturing spaces, creative office spaces, housing, an amphitheater, and rooftop spaces  (Barragan). The development would add to the current issue of gentrification that Lincoln Heights experienced. Commercial business growth may lead to “rampant real estate speculation [that] would negatively impact [the barrio], causing massive problems” (Diaz, 40).
