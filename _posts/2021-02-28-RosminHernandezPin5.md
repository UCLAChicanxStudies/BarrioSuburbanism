The North Hollywood Metro Station is located between the NOHO Arts District and a mainly Latinx residential area. It bustles with Latinx street vendors selling food or handmade jewelry. The station has been important for working-class Latinx families, who rely on public transportation to reach their destinations. “Major employment centers”, like Downtown Los Angeles and West Los Angeles, that depend on low wage labor have valued public transportation as it created a link to residential areas and steady economy from the consistent ridership (Diaz, 2005, p. 33). However, in an effort to attract more tourism, a “$1-billion plan” is underway to transform the “desolate” station that merely looked like “the end of the line” (Vincent, 2019). Essentially, this disregards the existing Latinx community that lack the means to afford rising rent prices. Due to rapid gentrification taking place, in the last five years, the Latinx population in the immediate neighborhood dropped by 15 percent (Social Explorer, n.d.).
