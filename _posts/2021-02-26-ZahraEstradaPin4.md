The building where the Paramount Ballroom was located was built in 1925 and was a space where Jewish socialists ran a community resource center in the 1920s and 1930s (Bautista, 2019). Before World War II, Boyle Heights contained a large Jewish population that was very politically active and had a large presence in the community. Racial and ethnic ideology began to shift in the 1940s as Jewishness was revised into Caucasian whiteness (Sanchez, 636).  Due to racial segregation Boyle Heights was a “melting pot” area until the war disrupted the populations and forced many to leave (Sanchez, 637). In the 1920s, the Paramount Ballroom would play Yiddish socialist hymns and jazz, but by the 1950s, the it was a location where people could enjoy the sounds of “jazz, cumbia, merengue, mambo, samba, and salsa” (BH History Studios & Tours, 2019). The shifts in the types of music being played represents the shift in demographics in Boyle Heights. As more Latino/a/xs moved into the neighborhood, the Paramount Ballroom would host concerts and dances with different types of Latin and Chicano music. Music and the performing arts continues to be a major part of the Boyle Heights community today as the same building is now used by the Boyle Heights Arts Conservatory, which provides youth and formerly incarcerated youth with free arts classes and workshops. Since 2011, this nonprofit organization has become a great resource for the people in Boyle Heights and “represents a site that lends itself to forging a sense of community based on cross-cultural and intergenerational activism and collaboration” (Bautista, 2019).
