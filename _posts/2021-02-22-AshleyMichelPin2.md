Normont Elementary School is a public school located in the Harbor Gateway region of South Los Angeles. The school is governed by the Los Angeles Unified School District and offers grades K-5. This school is significant to the Latine population because it offers a Spanish/English Dual-Language program beginning in Kindergarten, meaning that the majority of instruction is carried out in Spanish. 

Since the repeal of Proposition 227 in 2016, dual-immersion programs have grown in California public schools, offering an educational experience that captures young children’s cognitive benefits. Dual-immersion is built on substantial research that shows that cultural competence and language development are enhanced among bilingual children and does not hinder English-language proficiency or acquisition (1). Latinx students at Normont have the opportunity to nurture their linguistic roots, especially after enduring a history where bilingualism was institutionally banned by English-only legislation as well as socially stigmatized by assimilationist projects(3).
