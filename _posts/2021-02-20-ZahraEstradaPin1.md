The Boyle Hotel was created in 1889 when the suburb was wealthy and rural. The Victorian-style building was used to hold special gatherings by wealthy families and businessmen in a time when Boyle Heights had a prominent Jewish population and had a  multiethnic community (Nunez, 2011). Boyle Heights was targeted by the federal government through fiscal policies, redlining, restrictive covenants, and racial segregation. These policies and practices coupled with the aftermath of World War II transformed Boyle Heights as more immigrants settled in the Eastside of Los Angeles. The Jewish population of Boyle Heights out-migrated to the Westside. and by 1955 Mexicans would form almost half of the residents (Sanchez, 634). In 2006, the East L.A. Community Corporation bought the Boyle Hotel and rehabilitated the building into 51 units of affordable housing and a Mariachi Cultural Center (“Boyle Hotel, California”). The apartments are mostly occupied by mariachi musicians, who look for work across the street at the Mariachi Plaza. Latino/as now make up 94% of the population in Boyle Heights (LA Times). This represents the migration of Latina/os specifically to East L.A. because of racial segregation, which marked West L.A. “as middle class and a zone of whiteness” (Sanchez, 635). The Boyle Hotel signifies how legal policies of segregation and immigration transforms an area’s population and demographics over time.
