While living in the San Gabriel Valley all of my cousins attended Rosemead High School. The demographics of the school reflect those of the city’s with a 49% Latina/o population and a 47% Asian population (Great Schools). My cousin, being Mexican and Chinese, does not perfectly fit the expectations that can come with being Asian or Latina/o. The chapter, “The Asian and Latino Thing in Schools” discusses the “achievement gap” between Asian and Latina/o students at Alhambra High School and the “model minority myth” which creates inherent racialized expectations for the achievement of Asian-Americans (Cheng 71). These issues at Alhambra are paralleled at Rosemead with similar disparities between Latina/o and Asian-American students with test scores and college readiness (Great Schools). These disparities are part of larger social structures and histories surrounding discrimination against Asians and Latinas/os and the history of suburbanization inequalities in Rosemead.
