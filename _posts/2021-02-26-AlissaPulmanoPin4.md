The Latino Family Institute (LFI) originally served as a project under the El Centro Human Services Corporation (“Latino Family Institute History”). Since 1989, the organization has provided adoptive or foster children and parents with culturally active guidance. LFI supports various communities, including Black foster youths and parents as well as the LGBTQIA+ community. However, it primarily serves Latinx families that experience linguistic and cultural barriers that produce insufficient processes regarding adoption and foster care. Overall, LFI helps ameliorate the well-being of Southern California’s Latinx population, since over 9,000 foster children in Los Angeles County are Latinx but there are less than 2,000 Latinx foster parents (Henderson). Institutions like LFI exemplify how the Latinx community actively cultivates “awareness of structural inequality and a concern for social justice,” in order to aid marginalized groups that face socioeconomic and linguistic difficulties in America (Carpio, 00:35:33-00:35:52).
