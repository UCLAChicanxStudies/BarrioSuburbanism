Manzanita Park resides in Hacienda Heights right between three schools: Kwis Elementary School, Newton Middle School, and Los Altos High School. It was originally named Kwis Avenue Neighborhood Park until it was changed to Manzanita Park in 1959 by a recommendation from the Department of Parks and Recreation (Historic Timeline). This was done because of the presence of a growing Hispanic population, especially within the aforementioned schools. When Manzanita Park opened in 1964 it gave the Latinx students attending the surrounding schools a sense of community and solidarity (Deverell, 165). For many students it was their first time partaking in athletic activities outside of the streets, as participating in organized sport leagues often was too costly for Hispanic immigrant families. The community center at the park also offered free after school programs for youth that provided these students an opportunity to advance their education outside of the classroom.
