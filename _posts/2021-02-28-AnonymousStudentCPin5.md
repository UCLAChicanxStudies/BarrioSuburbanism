An organization rooted in Boyle Heights since 1973 with the mission of combining art and social justice in order to foster and develop local artists (selfhelpgraphics.com). They celebrate Chicanx culture and stories through the various workshops and events they host year round. Self Help Graphics and Arts emphasizes and embraces the Dia de Los Muertos Celebration through the tradition of building altars with photographs and marigolds to commemorate loved ones who have passed. Dia de Los Muertos is a popular celebration among the Chicanx community and Self Help Graphics is ensuring it carries on to the younger generations. Self Help Graphics was embedded and born out of the Chicano Moratorium and Chicano Movement in Boyle Heights by holding space for artists to express their activism in nontraditional art forms (Cheng, 2012). It continues to be a cultural resource for local organizations and social justice movements by providing tools for banner making and community building.
