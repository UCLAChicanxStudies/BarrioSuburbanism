The Korean Bell of Friendship is a monument gifted to the US in 1967 by the Republic of Korea to celebrate the two countries' relationship. The monument was then placed at the top of a hill facing the city and the Pacific Ocean in Joan Milke Flores Park, San Pedro. Furthermore, 51% of the area residents are White, while Latinx makes 33%, Black 6%, and Asian 4% according to the Statistical Atlas. It also important to note that, when comparing the real estate in Zillow, the residence around the monument is above the average for San Pedro. Therefore, the few Latinx that reside around these neighborhoods also show income mobility to afford the property. Ultimately, the Korean Bell of Friendship is an interesting place, a monument that celebrates Korean-American ties with a strong Latinx and White base community and serves as a place where people from all backgrounds can congregate.
