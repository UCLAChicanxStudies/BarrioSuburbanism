Pomona College was built in 1887. With the onset of the 20th century, Winston Dickson became the first African American student to enroll at Pomona College. This reflects how progressive the college was in terms of race. The city of Claremont is racially diverse, and the college accepted these students into their school. While the most common race at the school currently is white, just under a quarter of the students are Latino. Pomona college also boasts a strong natural sciences program, making it the most popular major. The school also currently has students from all 50 states, as well as students from 59 foreign countries. The largest type of school represented is public schools, followed by independent schools and then international schools.
