Since 1930 Mariachi Plaza has served as a home for the Mariachis of Los Angeles who aim to preserve the cultural heritage of the community through music (Lopez Kurland, 2008). Locals can always count on finding a mariachi willing to perform at any event at Mariachi Plaza. The plaza also serves as a community space where plenty of social and political events are hosted. It is a hotspot for local vendors especially on the weekends when you can find tamales, Mexican snacks, art, handmade jewelry, and much more being sold. The local street vendors and the mariachis that have established clientele at Mariachi Plaza cultivated a site that largely contributes to the informal economy of Boyle Heights (Cheng, 2012). Although threatened to be displaced by multiple proposed development plans after Metro Goldline’s Mariachi Plaza station was built, it has been the community, mariachis, and street vendors that continue to fight for the economic and cultural hub they have constructed.
