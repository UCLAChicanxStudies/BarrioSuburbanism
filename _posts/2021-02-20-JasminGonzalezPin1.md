Located in the city of Huntington Park, this park is named after the city’s first Latino mayor Raul R. Perez. Perez was an active member in the community; he was involved in various organizations to serve the residents of Huntington Park. He was elected as mayor in 1991 after five consecutive failed campaigns (“Raul R. Perez”). This park is only one part of Perez’s legacy, but it shows how important Latino civil representation is, particularly in suburban neighborhoods where Latinos experience “uneven acceptance into the suburban good life” (Gonzales 75). Perez is only one example of how Latinos can successfully engage in suburban politics and shape their communities.
