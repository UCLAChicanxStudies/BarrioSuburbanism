Casa Primera is an adobe-style structure that was built in 1837. It is located on the border of Claremont and Ontario, and is the oldest home in the valley. It was declared a historic landmark in 1954. Similarly to the Claremont Depot, the architecture of the Casa reflects that seen in barrios throughout Los Angeles. The original tenet of the building, Francisco Palomares, discovered the first well in the valley and began planting orange trees. This Casa is a preserved example of the type of homes that farmers and immigrants lived in and shows how Chicanos survived economically.
