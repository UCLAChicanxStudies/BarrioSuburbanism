Developed in the late 1800s, Logan Barrio is one of the oldest barrios in Orange County and one of the few neighborhoods in Santa Ana in which Latinx immigrants were able to move into at that time (Irving).  Historically, many Latinx barrios have fallen victim to displacement due to freeway construction and urban renewal projects (González 3). This has also happened in Logan Barrio as the neighborhood was marked a “blighted area” in the 1970s and has faced threats of removal by multiple development projects. While many Latinx residents were removed from the neighborhood due to construction of the Santa Ana Freeway and widening of major roads, residents of Logan Barrio have since then protested against development projects that threatened their livelihoods (Londoño 124). Successfully mobilizing against developments such as an industrial park and waste companies (Irving), many Logan Barrio residents have been able to live in their neighborhood for generations without being displaced.
