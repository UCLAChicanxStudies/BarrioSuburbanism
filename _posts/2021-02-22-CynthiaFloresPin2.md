The Misión Vieja or the Old Mission was constructed in 1771 by fathers Pedro Cambon and Angel Somera. In 1776 Montebello had a flash flood that ruined the Mission’s infrastructure. Since the flooding the Mission has been relocated to its current location in the San Gabriel Mountains (Zorro, 2010). However, a monument has been placed in its original location in South Montebello along a path. From a critical perspective, the Old Mission signifies the displacement endured by the Kizh, a Californian Native American group (Forbes, 1934). In the 16th century when Roman Catholic Spanish missions began to establish themselves throughout Southern California, the Kizh nation increasingly faced the threat of assimilation. Furthermore, this plaque is symbolic of a larger violence that took place and affected thousands. As a result of Spanish colonization there were only 20,000 California Native which had earlier been at 310,000 (Simmons 1997). The plaque marker is a reminder that Montebello’s history was violent, and such violence has often been forgotten.
