Diaz claimed that the social construction of a barrio with mixed housing types, commercial retail directly within residential zones and a community celebrating their own being is not necessarily new but rather deeply rooted. When Azalea Regional Shopping Center was approved by the city of South Gate and opened in 2014, it was meant to be an investment to bring more revenue, business, and increased sales taxes into the underserved community. This idea is not unique as Diaz mentioned, rather it is historical to have centers as such serving a purpose for the community. Azalea also celebrates the being of the residents in the city, like Diaz anticipated, by hosting Christmas and other holiday events where large crowds gather, eat, shop, and have fun. This was the first time the city had secured any major development and it allowed for many of the city to find employment in this center.
