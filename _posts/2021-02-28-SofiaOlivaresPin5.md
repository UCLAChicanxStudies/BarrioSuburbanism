Willowick Golf Course is a 102-acre public area located in West Santa Ana under ownership of the adjacent city of Garden Grove since the 1950s. Recently the city council has begun accepting development proposals to convert this space into commercial businesses, market-rate housing, or arenas that would raise revenue for both cities (Kopetman). Local community groups oppose these developments due to fears of rent increases and displacement of nearby Latinx neighborhoods. They have instead advocated for affordable housing and green space, which would alleviate the surrounding community’s high exposure to pollution concentrations (Barajas-Tena). Because the predominantly Latinx city only dedicates 4% of its space to parks and recreation (San Román), converting Willowick into green space would address possible equity issues as Pulido et al. point to white-dominant neighborhoods having greater access to green space than communities of color (94). For now, the community awaits final decisions on redevelopment plans and how that will affect their livelihoods.
