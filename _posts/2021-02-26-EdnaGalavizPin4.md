El Mercadito de Los Angeles was first opened in 1968 by Art Chaya and served as a multi-ethnic market where you could find a variety of products by and for the Mexican, Japanese and Italian communities (Los Angeles Conservancy). It is now closely associated to the Latinx community due to the demographic changes exacerbated by redlining policies in the area. The early characterization of Chicanx urban barrios in the southwest included the dominance of Chicanx small businesses in the barrio commercial sector due to the ethnically distinct services and goods they provided in contrast to their Anglo American counterparts (Diaz, 33). El Mercadito continues to embody those early characteristics of the formation of urban barrios.The three story indoor market is a one-stop shop for all types of Latinx delicacies, snacks, artifacts, herbs, medicines, jewelry, music and so much more. A popular spot for the locals to spend their Sunday afternoon as well as a major attraction for visitors from around the world.
