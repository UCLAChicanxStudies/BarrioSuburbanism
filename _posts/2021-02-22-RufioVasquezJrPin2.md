Built in 1883 for Geronimo and Catalina Lopez and one of the oldest private residences in the San Fernando Valley as well as the first two-story adobe home there. The Lopezes were considered San Fernando’s “First Family” and founded the first English speaking school and post office. The home is a reminder of San Fernando’s Mexican Catholic Mission roots and survived the racialized architectural turnover from adobe to brick at the turn of the century (Deverell 135). Uniquely, the home’s architecture is a blend of both Mission-style and Victorian—a stylistic representation of the blend of cultures present since San Fernando’s inception. The Lopez family lived in the home until the 1960s until its purchase by the city in 1971. Today it is a historical landmark, museum, and attraction. (Satzman)
