This theater is located on Pacific Boulevard which is a well-known shopping district within the Latino community of Los Angeles. It was closed in the 1990s but remained a landmark site in the city. The Latino community shapes this site as it has culturally enhanced pacific boulevard and its shops. As stated in the book “In Search of the Mexican Beverly Hills” it states that “discrimination colored every dimension of suburbanization throughout the 1960s, but Mexican Americans forged ahead” (Gonzalez, 2018). Huntington Park changed from a predominantly white and middle-class suburb to a predominantly Latino and low-income suburb. Once the movie theater was closed, the neighboring theater continued to cater to the community. The up and running Metropolitan Park Twin Theater caters to its Spanish speaking residents by playing their movies in Spanish and adding Spanish subtitles to the movies in English.
