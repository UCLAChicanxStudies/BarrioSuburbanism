Dodger stadium was the result of Walter O’Malley, president of the Brooklyn Dodgers, not being able to secure a stadium in Brooklyn, prompting his move to Los Angeles in the 50s. (DeFrank) Chavez Ravine, prior to the Dodgers securing the land rights in 58’, was originally home to several barrios inhabited by a redlined Mexican-American population suited with a school and small businesses. Regarded as a derelict slum, Chavez Ravine was pegged for urban renewal due to its proximity to downtown Los Angeles causing the city to approve the land for a low-rent housing development leading to its clearance by 1952. (Shatkin) With the land now empty, Mayor Norris Poulson halted the construction and inquired with the Dodgers to buy the land and settle the franchise dubbed “the sweetheart deal.” (Gonzalez) Dodger stadium was opened in 1962 and serves as an example of “urban renewal” being forced on ethnic communities.
