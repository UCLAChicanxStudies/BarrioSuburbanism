Tierra Mia opened its first location in South Gate in 2008. The SG location has remained the primary hub despite there being 13 more current locations. It has become the hangout spot for high schoolers, teachers, and is the only local coffee shop that has given any competition to larger chains in the area such as Starbucks. This is significant because the collective identity that this place has created with the community has allowed the business to flourish. Here, people are proud to represent not only Mexico, but Central American countries as well. They speak Spanish comfortably and continue traditions as is, like having “chocolate abuelita with a pan” on a winter night; they do so without thinking like those in the article about Downey being the Mexican Beverly Hills, without shame or trying to erase their culture. This location has brought diversity as well as much needed unity in the city.
