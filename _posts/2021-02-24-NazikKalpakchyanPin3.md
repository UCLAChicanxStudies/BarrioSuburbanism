El Sauz Tacos is a Mexican eatery located in Glendale, California, which serves traditional Mexican foods such as tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and so forth.  El Sauz is considered a "hit" amongst Glendale's youth and is even claimed to be one of the best Mexican restaurants in the Glendale region because of its reasonable prices and welcoming atmosphere (Melkonian 2018). Through the serving of ethnic Mexican foods, El Sauz brings diversity to Glendale's restaurants. The diverse foods it provides are significant because suburbia, according to Nicolaides and Weise, is defined by inclusivity and exclusivity. As a result, people of color and their cultures are often subject to exclusion (Nicolaides and Weise 2016, 1). In suburbia, cultural assimilation and uniformity are praised. Therefore, through its establishment, El Sauz fights against such norms and allows Glendale's residents to appreciate diverse cultural foods. In fighting against such standards, El Sauz adds to the overall American culture, making it "richer than it is at the present time" (Sanchez 2004, 643).
