North Whittier Heights was a subdivision of land full of lemon and orange orchards which later became Hacienda Heights. This region attracted many immigrant families because living in a vegetated, fertile region would allow them to grow food from their homes, lowering the cost of expenses (Suburban Reader, 200). Additionally, it offered them labor opportunities, especially in the North Whittier Heights Citrus Association’s packing houses. This association like many others helped sponsor a housing program initially championed by The California Fruit Growers Exchange organization. This program provided citrus workers, many of which were Mexican families, housing and water on the ranches with the condition that they were available to work at any time in the year (Gonzalez, 295). The North Whittier Heights Citrus Association needed the labor of the Mexican immigrant population to survive. In turn a Latinx community began to grow in Hacienda Heights and gain economic mobility.
