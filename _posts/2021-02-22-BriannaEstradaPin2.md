 In the 1960’s, Lynwood was the postwar manifestation of the American Dream for many World War II veterans and their young families. During the post war period, many Mexican American’s sought to achieve this American Dream but struggled to claim a space and gain opportunities. With the influx of many minorities trying to obtain the same peace and prosperity in this country others were receiving, the Mexican American community believed it was best to work collectively.“Many who were denied [socioeconomic ladder opportunities] ]continued to find ways to crack the barrier surrounding new suburban tract developments'' (González, 48). New Voice Immigration Assistance Services, is one of many developments in Lynwood that has given the Latino community a sense of unity and support. This non-profit organization that leads by faith focuses on serving and empowering the Lynwood immigrant community through the services offered by their immigration legal office. The actions within this organization include advocating, representing and volunteering to help immigrants in detention centers.
