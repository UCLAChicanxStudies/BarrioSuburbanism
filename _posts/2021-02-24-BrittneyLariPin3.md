The San Fernando Gardens, also known as “The Projects,” were built in 1955 and are currently still in use today. Originally, these projects were made to house workers, mainly African-American, during World War II. Over time, there have been an increasing number of Latinxs moving into the city, which now make up over 90% of residents living in this project. The San Fernando Gardens was the last project built in Los Angeles and is the only project in the San Fernando Valley. For 36 years, San Fernando Gardens was the only project in Los Angeles without a community center, until 1991, where city and federal officials approved of this necessary change. This was especially groundbreaking for the residents in this project, as this community center would now offer many useful programs, such as, a day care for residents needing to leave for work, and educational and vocational programs for immigrant adults with English as a second language.
