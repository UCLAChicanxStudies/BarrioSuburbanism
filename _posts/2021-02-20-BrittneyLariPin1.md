The Los Angeles Mural Mile, created in 2012, is located along Van Nuys Boulevard, in the hometown of Pacoima. The Mural Mile is roughly three miles of beautiful, colorful, storytelling art that tells the history of this suburban community.  “El Nido Family Centers Mural,” painted by Manny Valezquez, is one of the many murals located among the city and the Mural Mile. Manny Valezquez has been painting murals in this city since the 1970s, which was when the Latino population started to surge and when Pocoima had one of the worst economies in the San Fernando Valley. During this time, where the Mural Mile is located, Valezquez recalls this street being filled with prostition corners and liquor stores. As a career, Valezquez worked with at-risk youth and became a mentor for them as they collaborated in art projects throughout the Pacoima, beautifying the city and inspiring the future generations.
