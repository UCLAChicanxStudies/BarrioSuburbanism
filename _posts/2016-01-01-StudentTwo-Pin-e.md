This library is located in a central space with City Hall, the Rosemead Chamber of Commerce, a market plaza and residential spaces on adjacent streets. Inside is a communal Children’s Area with multiple desks. This communal space focused on family interaction is a reflection of Rosemead’s current investment on fostering a diverse city. This is related to the term “contact hypothesis”, defined by Ochoa as “the more frequent the interaction, the less likely the conflict” (Ochoa 127). From a suburb in the 1930s that was exclusively white to a multiethnic majority Asian and Latina/o suburb today, spaces such as a public library contribute to understandings borne from shared space. Visiting on a Saturday afternoon the multiethnic demographics consisted of children, adults and elderly. While exploring the space I came across a manga graphic novel in Spanish which is an interesting window into the mix of cultures situated in Rosemead.
