Rosemead City Hall is located next to the Rosemead Library and the Rosemead Chamber of Commerce. The sculpture “Reflect” which commemorates the deaths of September 11 along with a Vietnam Veterans Memorial ring the outside of the building. The sculpture consists of hands supporting a beam from the World Trade Center symbolizing the support of emergency responders on that day (City of Rosemead). These memorials serve as reminders to unite a community following the loss of lives but it could also be a vehicle to neglect the additional histories such as the ensuing islamophobia following 9/11 and the loss of life in Vietnam and the diaspora of Vietnamese refugees into locations such as Rosemead with Vietnam being the immigrant population’s most common country of origin (Mapping L.A.).
