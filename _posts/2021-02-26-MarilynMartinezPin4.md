Los Poblanos Restaurant located in Glendale, California is operated and owned by the Cuateco family. They originally immigrated from Puebla, Mexico during the 1990s. They are best known for their take on mole y Arroz, cemitas, and enchiladas. Their restaurant adds to Glendale, California a much-needed representation of Southern Mexico. The owners like many other suburbanites of color express “recognizable values in regard to…economic independence…and family life” (Nicolaides and Weise, 2006). They have expressed their values of economic independence through the founding of their restaurant. Moreover, the value they have placed on family life explains why their restaurant is exclusively operated by immediate family members. As one customer maintained, they have a “small staff”, yet they consistently manage to “work hard and…give the best service” (Luis M, 2021). Further, the myriad of positive reviews on Yelp demonstrates that the restaurant has built a prominent network of customers through incredible customer service and delicious Poblano cuisine.
