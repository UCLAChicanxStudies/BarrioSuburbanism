In 1911, two women proposed to local school district officials a petition to build a new school to service Casa Blanca, a predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood that was gravely under-resourced (Vasquez, 2017). These women successfully empowered their community through education. As described in the Weise reading, schools focused on serving Mexicans were unfortunately still discriminated against (Wiese, 2008). The Casa Blanca school would later burn down.

In contemporary times, local Casa Blanca residents collaborated with the City of Riverside to improve the conditions of their neighborhood. Thanks to these efforts, today “the Casa Blanca Library offers a Family Learning Center, a computer lab and over 43,000 books, video tapes and CDs, as well as the largest Spanish language collection in the City library system.” (City of Riverside, n.d.). The advocacy and self expressed agency from Latinxs in the Casa Blanca neighborhood makes it a more empowered community today.
