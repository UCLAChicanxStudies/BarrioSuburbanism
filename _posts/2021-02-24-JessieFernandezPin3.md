Since its founding in 1998, Taqueria Tamazulena can be seen as a place where both Mexican food and culture can be celebrated. However, it was not always this way, and in Ontario’s long history, this neighborhood was predominantly white and refused to welcome Mexican culture. Through the uprising of the city, Ontario did not have many businesses that offered Mexican products and foods. It was not until the influx of Hispanic migrants when Ontario saw a boom in businesses that offered services tailored towards Mexicans exhibited through language as well as the hiring of bilingual staff-- providing jobs for many Hispanic residents in Ontario. Another significant feature of this establishment was that it was one of the few establishments that initiated the push for Hispanic-owned business in Ontario unlike other parts of the city that tended to alienate barrio consumers through language barriers and lack of Mexican products (Diaz, 33).
