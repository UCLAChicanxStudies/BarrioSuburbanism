The term “ethnoburb” coined by geographer Wei Lei refers to a suburb in which one or more immigrant groups dominate the spatial landscape, businesses and culture (Hardwick 45). This is a prime example of Santa Ana and is especially true of Fiesta Marketplace previously located in downtown Santa Ana. Fiesta Marketplace was an open-area commercial district that contained Latinx-owned businesses selling products such as quinceañera dresses, Spanish records, and Mexican boots (Gonzalez and Sarmiento). Because the businesses were catered for the surrounding Latinx population of Santa Ana, Fiesta Marketplace held a massive influence in the community for decades following its opening in the late 1980s. However, recent city renewal and gentrification efforts have changed the overall landscape into a more modern commercial area called East End that is targeted towards non-Latinx visitors (Galvin). Despite these efforts to erase a significant feature of the city’s cultural landscape, Fiesta Marketplace is remembered for its representation of the larger Latinx population.
