Located in the heart of Lincoln Heights, on the corner of N Broadway and Daly Boulevard, is Los Dos Streetscapers’ first mural. This mura, which sits on the exterior walls of East West Bank, depicts the hundreds of years of Chicano history. The history is painted on 5 various panels throughout the building, each one representing different eras leading up to the largest panel that represents “Chicano life in the US, and in Lincoln Heights” (Latinopia Art Chicano Time Trip, 1:28 - 1:32). This mural focuses on the identity of the community of Lincoln Park, The Chicano Civil Rights Movement influenced the mural scene, murals depicted the racial struggles faced by Mexican-Americans and affirmed cultural identity.

“Chicano time trip, 1977, East West Bank, 2601 North Broadway (at Daly Boulevard), exterior. This was the Streetscapers' first collaborative project (not counting their 3rd grade dinosaur mural). The concept of depicting hundreds of years of Chicano history came in response to the 1976 U.S. Bicentennial, which didn't address the Chicano heritage. The panels read right to left and cover pre-Columbian society, the Spanish conquest and colonialism, Mexican independence and the rise of a new ruling class, the Mexican Revolution and the contemporary Chicano Family. In acrylic on stucco, 5 panels, 20' x 90' by Los Dos Streetscapers (Wayne Healy and David Botello). Sponsored by Citywide Mural Project and Crocker Bank.” Source: Dunitz, Robin J., Robin Dunitz Slides of Los Angeles Murals, 1925-2002/ University of Southern California Digital Library
