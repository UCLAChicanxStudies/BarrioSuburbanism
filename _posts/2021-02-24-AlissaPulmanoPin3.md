Aside from the generic department stores and local cinemas, The Lakes Mall of West Covina consists of brujería (witchcraft) stores and Indigenous vendors that aim to preserve the spiritual aspects of Indigenous, Latinx, and/or Central American cultures. These stores and vendors carry immense cultural significance as they provide opportunities for “Chicanos coming from Indigenous backgrounds” to reconnect with their pre-colonialist ancestral roots and “[reclaim] that indigeneity” (Carpio, 01:29:02-01:29:11). These shops also provide another source of income for Indigenous and Latinx communities that have “entered into a range of service and retail sectors in direct competition with Euro-American businesses” (Diaz, 33). These cultural stores and vendors within West Covina’s main shopping center are a reflection of the city’s large Latinx and Indigenous population, considering that stores are typically created to meet consumer demands (“West Covina, CA”).
