This site has been one of the central figures of Boyle Heights, with many postcards, “including real photo cards, professionally published in the first few decades of the 20th century demonstrating its importance”(Water and Power). Although it was established as a community park, it fell in line with the citywide effort to beautify urban environments, which were created, in part, to serve as an incentive for investment in the surrounding land. Development in West L.A. and east downtown pushed Mexicans further east, transitioning Boyle Heights from “a middle and upper-class residential suburb to a working and middle-class enclave” (Water and Power). Industry expansion established a pattern of environmental racism that left working-class Latinas/os bearing the effects of pollution and displacement. Most famously was the displacement caused by the construction of the Golden State Freeway through Boyle Heights. Pasadena city residents fought to reroute and are now beside Hollenbeck park, allowing other suburbs access to downtown.
