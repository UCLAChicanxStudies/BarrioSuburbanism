desc: "A landmark and staple to the Latinx residents for its services, the cemetery also demonstrates the remnants of the once multiethnic community."

The 1920 housing restrictions limited immigrants to the east side, bringing Chinese, Russian, Jewish, Armenian, and Japanese immigrants. After World War II, with a decline in residential segregation, many, especially children of immigrants, moved farther east to the San Gabriel Valley suburbs. Monuments within the site stand as a reminder of its diverse past and ethnic segregation of its beginning, like the shrine erected by the Chinese community in 1888 and a memorial for the 442nd Infantry Regimental Combat Unit of Japanese soldiers. While racial segregation provided limited access to the cemetery and spaces for physical activity, Latinx people took over the area and transformed it to suit their needs. As of 2008, there is a jogging path added around the cemetery as well as exercise equipment. School track teams and other youth frequent the running trail; even older people use the machines, running, or walking their dogs.
