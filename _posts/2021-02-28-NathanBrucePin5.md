Chula Vista’s Third Avenue is an important commercial area for residents of the thriving and diverse suburb. It is home to dozens of businesses, ranging from restaurants, bars and breweries to museums and tattoo shops. The businesses in the area are represented in a non-profit organization known as the Third Avenue Village Association. The Association provides various services and organizes cultural events such as the annual Lemon Festival, which celebrates the city’s agricultural heritage (“What We Do”). Latinx people, particularly Latinx immigrants, are very well-represented among Chula Vista’s business owners, including those along Third Avenue, with Chula Vista even being ranked the #1 city in the U.S. for immigrant integration in 2020 (Mendoza). Despite this high degree of Latinx representation, POC business owners are still unfortunately suffering from a level of inequity, as they have reportedly been having a more difficult time with accessing money and opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic (Solis).
