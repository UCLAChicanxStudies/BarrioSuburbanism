Los Tres Hermanos Restaurant, a small chain founded in Zacatecas, Mexico in 1988 and later moved to San Fernando by Magdaleno Gutierrez and his three sons. Though there are many great Mexican restaurants in San Fernando, this one is remarkable for its excellent food and its relatable story of Latinx people’s immigration from Mexico to the United States in pursuit of the American Dream. (Gutierrez 2021) Like so many other immigrants searching for economic security, the Gutierrez family established themselves and planted the seeds of their economic future in San Fernando, creating a cultural bridge between their homeland and the place they now call home (Nicolaides and Weise 2006, 212). By continuing the traditions of Mexican cooking in the United States, the Gutierrez family played an active role in the changeover from San Fernando’s historically white population to its current one, overwhelmingly Latinx, and that cultural bridge they have built serves as a connection to home for the wider community.
