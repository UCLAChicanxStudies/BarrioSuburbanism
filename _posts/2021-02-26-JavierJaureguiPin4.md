The days of serving as a theatre are long gone for the Westlake Theatre. The Westlake Theatre, since its closure in 1991, has been transformed from a space for entertainment and performing arts to a swap meet (Lee, 57). This transformation came from the shift in community demands with the drastic switch of demographics in Westlake when “white flight” began to occur in the area with the arrival of Chicanx and Central Americans in the Westlake area (Diaz, 28). Needing to make a living wage, many Chicanx and Central Americans upon arrival to Westlake resorted to creating their own small family businesses. The demand for small business units gave rise to Westlake Theatre’s change of usage as a space where Chicanx and Central Americans could engage and thrive in a market environment. Unfortunately, due to new ownership, the future of Westlake Theatre continuing to serve as a swap meet is unknown. Regardless, the market environment cultivated by Chicanx and Central Americans in Westlake continues to be alive and thriving as street vendors and small family business shops can be found in the vicinity of MacArthur Park.
