Elizabeth Bakery has been one of the most popular bakeries in South Gate since the 70’s, mostly attracting people who fall in love with their bolillos. They are a Mexican dessert and favorites bakery serving traditional treats like conchas, cuernos, and other pan dulces. They also make cakes for celebrations. This bakery has become the hub of pan dulce in South Gate and surrounding areas and really serves to represent the community it is located in. It is a little piece of Mexico you can bring into your U.S home with a warm cafecito or a sweet abuelita chocolate. Though this bakery came after the 50’s when Mexican Americans experienced a hard time in suburbs due to continued segregation, this bakery is a testament to preserving a part of their identity and speaks to this identity crisis that many were going through because of their roots at the time.
