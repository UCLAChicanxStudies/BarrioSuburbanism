NAASCO traces its origins in Barrio Logan alongside the Naval Base during WWII. During which their presence brought about displacement to many homes along the bay and eliminated recreational usage of the shore indefinitely (Barley & Pearlman 1). These new industries eventually created a domino effect for further industrial zoning of the community,it is not uncommon to see houses next to factories and machine shops today. Concerns over the health of residents have been discussed since the genesis of industry in the region. The community has one of the highest rates of asthma-related hospitalizations in the state (Lopez-Villafaña). Barrio Logan serves as a case study example of one of many redlined communities across America that became targets for urban renewal projects after World War II (Carpio, Slide 8). NAASCO continues to affect the landscape and continues to be a source of conversation regarding local politics and zoning measures.
