Completed in October 1993, Interstate 105 was the last major freeway to open in the Los Angeles area. Interstate 105 runs along Imperial Highway from Norwalk to El Segundo and touches a multitude of cities, one being Lynwood, CA. “Urban renewal, the location of highway corridors, intensive industrial growth, and rampant real estate speculation would negatively impact barrios, causing massive problems” (Diaz, 40). Government agencies and realtors have worked together to create highways that connect cities yet divide communities. The western cities of Interstate 105 tend to have higher median household income and home values while the southern cities where Lynwood is located have a higher poverty rate and lower median household income.The displacement of housing (with no adequate replacement) and lower income in Lynwood due to Interstate 105 is a perfect example of how low-income and minority groups are frequently discriminated.
