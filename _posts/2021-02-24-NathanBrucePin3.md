In the 2018-19 academic year, over two-thirds of Southwestern College’s students identified as Hispanic/Latinx and nearly 90% were people of color (Southwestern College Factbook 9). Nearly 1,800 Hispanic/Latinx students graduated in 2019 (SWC Factbook 21) and over 500 transferred to UCs or CSUs (SWC Factbook 24). Having such a high degree of achievement with a large Hispanic/Latinx student body means that this school will certainly produce a number of future leaders and successful individuals in their community. One example of a young Latino leader amongst Southwestern’s alumni is Ammar Campa-Najjar, a two-time Democratic candidate for California’s 50th District in the U.S. House of Representatives (Reeder and Fritz). The fact that schools such as this one are able to provide a higher education to tens of thousands of  Latinx students is a tremendous sign of improvement from early 20th century Southern California, when Mexican-American students were forced to receive a second-class education in virtually segregated schools (Deverell 153-154).
