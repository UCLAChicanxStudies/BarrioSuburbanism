The Rubidoux swap meet was built during the 1950s when Riverside County was going through many changes. Big industry provided many Anglo-Americans with good paying jobs (Gonzales). WWII created many job opportunities that Mexican immigrants were ready to fill. As a result, white flight occurred and whites headed inland--toward Riverside. The Rubidoux Drive-In theater was created at this time. The Drive-In was a a gathering place for whites, adding to the idea of a "romantic suburb" where middle class America had very little worries. By the 1980s and 1990s many good paying industries had left Riverside County, resulting in the fleeing of whites. Jurupa Valley and areas near by became new "immigrant gateways," since new jobs that relied on cheap, flexible labor opened up (Audrey). The demographic shift transformed the Rubidoux Drive-In to the Rubidoux Swap Meet--a place that is now a Latino cutural hub.
