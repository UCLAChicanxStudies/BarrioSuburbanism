The Glendora Historical Society preserves Indigenous culture by exhibiting locally found Native American artifacts, like clay pots or tools carved from stone, which indicate that a peaceful hunter-gatherer tribe resided in West Covina for winter grounds (“Glendora Museum,” 00:00:30-00:00:41). The Glendora Historical Society creates “a more accepting public of mixed Native descent” by acknowledging West Covina’s mixed Native American and Latinx population and showcasing Native American cultural elements found within the region (Carpio, 00:29:16-00:29:25). The museum also exhibits memorabilia of the farmers who worked in the city’s citrus groves. Historically, millions of migrant workers from Latinx countries came to work in the fields of California. The early 1900s “marked the first sustained period of large-scale Mexican immigration to the United States” (Weise, 754). Consequently, new strategies, like worker housing and assimilation, were created to control the growing Latinx worker population (Carpio, 00:04:55-00:05:19). Eventually, this contributed to the creation of various Latinx suburban enclaves.
