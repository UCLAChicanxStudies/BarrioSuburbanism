The Boys and Girls Club of San Fernando Valley was founded in 1966 by a group of local business leaders as a small storefront in the city of Pacoima. It became one of the first centers in the city to be available for recreational and social activities, and is the oldest non-for-profit youth agency in the area. It soon grew to become a pinnacle for impoverished youth in the community. A few of the programs that the Club offers includes character and leadership development, sports and recreation activities, education and career growth, and a health and wellness program. For more than fifty years, the Boys and Girls Club family preservation program has aided families throughout Pacoima and surrounding regions, playing an integral role in areas such as counseling, child activities, clinical assessments, parenting training, and many other services.
