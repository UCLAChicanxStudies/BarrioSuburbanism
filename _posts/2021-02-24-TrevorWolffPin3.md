This passenger rail line ran from downtown Los Angeles to downtown San Bernardino and was built in 1927. A unique aspect of this depot is that the architecture is Spanish-colonial style. This reflects the style of architecture seen in many barrios throughout the city of Los Angeles. The passenger rail line was crucial to providing a way for Chicanos from barrios a way to travel between Los Angeles and San Bernardino. This was useful because it allowed Chicanos to get jobs in the city and a mode of affordable transportation.
