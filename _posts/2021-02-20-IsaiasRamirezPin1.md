Point Fermin Park, also known as Sunken City, is located in the southernmost part of San Pedro. Point Fermin Park is a trendy location for many reasons, such as its rich history, categorically stunning view, local businesses, and amenities. According to the Daily Breeze, the park was named after the Victorian-style lighthouse established in 1874. Furthermore, as stated by Statistical Atlas, the communities that reside around the park are majorly white, Hispanic, and Black; in that order. Moreover, a section of the park is kept isolated and closed to the public because of its unstable ground. This part of the park is Sunken City, once a beautiful exclusive neighborhood that fell victim to a landslide. However, Sunken City has become a popular destination for hikers and overall everyone despite the landslide. Thus, the park has become a cultural hub where people from different backgrounds come and interact.
