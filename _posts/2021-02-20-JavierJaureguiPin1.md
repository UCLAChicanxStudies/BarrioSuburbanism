Previously a church during the time where most of West Los Angeles had been “reserved for residential land use,” in 1983, CARECEN revitalized this space into CARCEN’s first office (Sanchez, 635). The shift from a church to a resource center for Central Americans exemplifies the dramatic shift of demographics in the Westlake neighborhood. As this neighborhood went from “a zone of whiteness” to a safe haven for many Central Americans who fled their home countries in the late 1900s due to ongoing violence and political instability occurring in many Central American countries like El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua (Sanchez, 635). CARECEN currently still utilizes this space to provide access to legal services for immigrants, youth leadership programs, their day labor center, and many more resources. CARECEN is a trailblazer when it comes to advocacy for the rights and needs of the Central American inhabitants of Westlake and the greater Los Angeles population.
