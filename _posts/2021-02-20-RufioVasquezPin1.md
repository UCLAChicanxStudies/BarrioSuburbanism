Established in 1896, San Fernando High School is both one of the oldest schools in Los Angeles and the alma mater of Ricardo Valenzuela, better known as the first Chicano rock star, Ritchie Valens. Producer Bob Keane recommended the name change, arguing that the “Caucasian Strategy” (Weise 752) was necessary to getting Valens’ songs on the radio. “I knew that if we put a record out and called him Valenzuela, they wouldn’t even listen to it. They’d just throw it in the trashcan” (PBS). Valens opened the door for future Latinx musicians like Freddy Fender and hit songs sung by Mexican Americans, like “96 Tears” (PBS). Though his life was cut short in the infamous plane crash that also took the lives of Buddy Holly and the “Big Bopper,” Valens remains one of San Fernando’s most beloved sons.
