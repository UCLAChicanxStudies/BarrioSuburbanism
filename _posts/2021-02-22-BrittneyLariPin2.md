In 1994, the Recreation and Parks Commission unanimously voted to rename Pacoima’s neighborhood park in honor of Richie Valens’ legacy. Valens, originally named Richard Valenzuela, was born in Pacoima. With his talent and love of music rooting at such a young age, he became the stepping stone for all future Chicano rock music artists. Despite all the barriers he surpassed, including changing his name so that he would sound more appealing to his Anglo audience, he opened the door for a lot of hispanic musical artists. The renaming of this recreation center, as well as other tributes to Valens scattered around Pacoima, serves as an inspiration to this growing Latinx community. This recreation center is a home for organized social activities for the Pacoima community and works as a way to bring together a very diverse Latinx community to enjoy common interests.
