Fronteras Del Norte is a family-owned company located along Pacific Boulevard. This bus service provides daily bus rides from Tijuana, Mexico to various sites in the U.S. (in Washington, Oregon, and California) and back. These bus rides fulfill the company’s mission statement of uniting family members living across the border and bringing individuals to jobs across the border (“About Us”), actions which otherwise would not have been possible without accessible transportation. In doing so, this company helps individuals move across the U.S.-Mexico border. This transnational movement of individuals in Huntington Park designates the city as an ethnic enclave, one in flux as individuals continually move in and out of the city, taking advantage of the resources and structures of the established Latinx community (Singer).
