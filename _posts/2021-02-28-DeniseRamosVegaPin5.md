The Latinx community is often overlooked in various manners and occasions, one being during the pandemic. Many Latinxs in Santa Ana do not have health insurance due to their immigration status and/or inability to pay for insurance which puts them at an increased risk. This is where organizations such as Latino Health Access come in to provide assistance to people within our community. Within “Twenty First Century Gateways” by Singer, Hardwick, and Brettell, they explain the ways in which cities serve as immigrant gateways and the changes occurring within them over time. Although not spoken of in the reading, Santa Ana came into my mind when I was thinking about gateway cities. Initiatives such as Latino Health Access help Latinx residents and maintain the city as a gateway city through all the assistance such organizations offer.
