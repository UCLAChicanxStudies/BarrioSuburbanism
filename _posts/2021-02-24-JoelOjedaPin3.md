El Batey Market was another one of the many cultural place-makers within Echo Park that offered laborers and the latino population goods like food, drinks and other general items while also being a venue of welcoming among people with shared cultural identity. Founded by Evelia Park and her husband in 1967 and being linked to El Nayarit through Parks familial ties with Natalia Barraza, her market was embraced and supported by the community for 50 years, so much so that the LA Times recognized Park as the “Spiritual anchor” of the community. (Molina) Yet, regardless of Park’s cultural stake in Echo Park, private businesses and gentrification began to take its toll. The combination of gentrification pushing out her regular customers (Eastsider) in conjunction with Parks landlords converting her building into an apartment structure and demanding astronomical rent increases, (Matthew) she eventually closed her doors in 2014 which has left a void in Echo Park ever since.
