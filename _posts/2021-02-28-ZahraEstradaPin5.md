In the early twentieth century, the population in Los Angeles was rapidly increasing. Local officials created “an intricate residential segregation that placed American-born Anglo newcomers on the west side of the city, while foreign-born and nonwhite residents found themselves largely confined to the east side” (Sanchez, 635). Many Mexican immigrants settled in Boyle Heights, including mariachi musicians, settled in Boyle Heights and transformed it into one of the most diverse geographic spaces in the United States. Los Angeles became a post-World War II gateway as an influx of immigrants began moving into the city (Singer, 9). Many of these immigrants from Latin America, particularly Mexico, settled in Eastside LA and used this space for economic opportunities. Mariachi plaza was originally an informal location that used to be a donut shop until it was replaced in 1998 by a “stone kiosk donated by the State of Jalisco, Mexico, and has become a landmark in the Boyle Heights community” (Rojas, 39). Mariachi plaza demonstrates how Latino/a/xs transformed Los Angeles’ inner-city by creating a space that was a multi-ethnic neighborhood, which then became a predominantly Latino/a/x neighborhood. Latino workers, in this case, mariachis, saw an opportunity in Boyle Heights to get employment and introduce Mariachi music to what was a Jewish community.
