Owned and created by Korean investors, Plaza Mexico was created to embody similar qualities and characteristics of the plaza’s in the country of Mexico. Plaza Mexico includes multi-purpose retail, individual stores, swap meet, dining and entertainment throughout the site. 
The features in Plaza Mexico allow visitors to transport into the culture and scenery of Mexico yet also embodies the forced segregation that the Latino community has faced over the years.With the Latino population being 86% and surpassing all other ethnicities in this city, Plaza Mexico is the main site that highlights and embraces this community. Due to Plaza Mexico’s location and spatialization, it is evident that the social history, Spanish language, Mexicana/o and border culture, and identity have produced the abstract yet tangible symbolism of “el barrio” within this site and the city (Diaz, 20). Between the various colorful structures and facades of this plaza you will find the history of spatialities and restrictions of the Latino community.
