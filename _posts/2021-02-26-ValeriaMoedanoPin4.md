St. Catherine of Alexandria has been the only Catholic Church in Temecula since the early 20th century. In 1916, the Diocese of the Catholic Church of Southern California purchased land and built the town’s first church to accommodate the local Catholic population (Lake Elsinore Valley Press). Today, the church draws a lot of Chicano/Latino parishioners. Due to this, the church offers mass, faith formation, and other services in Spanish. During December, the church holds events for Chicanos/Latinos to celebrate Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe and Las Posadas. After mass, parishioners gather in Di Leo hall to mingle, eat tamales and pozole, and listen to live Mariachi. In a majority white city, St. Catherine’s offers a space for Chicano/Latinos to keep their traditions alive and pass them down to the next generation, “in the belief that their continued reverence might promise a brighter future for their families'' (Gonzalez, 2018, pg. 29).
